For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.\n\nIt's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)\n\nAs I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.</td><td>10 20, 2010</td><td>A38NELQT98S4H8</td><td>WB Halper</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5</td><td>1287532800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed.

Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on \"the best way to lay out a site using CSS\" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.\n\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.\n\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\n\nUI - at the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.</td><td>10 18, 2010</td><td>A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</td><td>Grimmy</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A good value</td><td>1287360000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is \"Certified Associate,\" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\n\nWith this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from \"Adobe Certified Instructors\", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.\n\nFor the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a \"test\" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\n\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I've simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you'll be learning on the videos.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n1) HTML Refresher - This is an excellent section for someone who already knows HTML, but could use a refresher in the form of a \"crash course.\"  You'll find a URL overview, an HTML intro (tags, how some browsers read tags differently, and what Dreamweaver \"does behind the scenes).\n\n2) Dreamweaver Introduction - You'll finally be able to learn what WYSIWYG is, you'll be introduced to Dreamweaver Design, Code, and split screens, and the welcome screen.

This was a long review, but hopefully anyone looking for core training in web communication will now know exactly what they will receive when they purchase this program.</td><td>10 16, 2010</td><td>ACJT8MUC0LRF0</td><td>D.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.\n\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\n\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\n\n  What this is\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\n  - A great overview of using DW\n\nWhat it isn't\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.</td><td>10 12, 2010</td><td>AYUF7YETYOLNX</td><td>Bryan Newman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A Fantastic Overview of Dream Weaver and Web Design in General</td><td>1286841600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I decided (after trying a number of other products) to switch to the gold standard of web site management, Dreamweaver.

Both expect you already have the design part.\n\nI used a pure HTML editor, which for beginners is the best way to go. You'll learn HTML and CSS along with exactly how your code changes your page. DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, it's also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And that's where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in. It very clearly takes you through learning DW so that you can get on with designing web pages.\n\nExcellent addition to my library and excellent companion to Dreamweaver itself.

Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.\n\nThe opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\n\nI'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.\nAt some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version.

Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.\n\nThere are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.\n\nAll in all, this is a great product for the price.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A2WCFDOCS73PNB</td><td>Gadgetman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Excellent value for the price</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Even though I use Dreamweaver a great deal and own several books on the subject, I found this set very helpful. Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.\n\nThe videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (\"Fireworks\" for \"Firefox,\" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.\n\nSince each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the \"Watch and work\" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.\n\nNew features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.\n\nIf you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A14638TGYH7GD9</td><td>Rebecca Haden</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Buy this with your copy of Dreamweaver</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.\n\nI should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\n*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\n* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\n* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\n* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\n* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\n* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.\n* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\n* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\n\nNOT SO POSITIVE:\n* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.\n* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.\n* There is no \"search\" function or \"index.\" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.\n* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\n* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\n\nOn the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\n\nVideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.</td><td>10 21, 2010</td><td>A2VWE5SGNDS8HW</td><td>tachi1</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Competent introduction to Dreamweaver and web principles.</td><td>1287619200</td><td>false</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>0321700945</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>As someone who has just upgraded from Lightroom version 2 to the new version 3, I got this to bring me up to speed on the new features.

The book has a chapter on being a better photographer and another introducing the new features of Lightroom 3. The DVD contains the videos and a dedicated video player.  You can either use Internet Explorer or the player to view the content. My recommendation is to use the player.  It's full featured... a nice menu system, resizing for the screen, and the normal control buttons (stop, pause, play, etc.). The nicest feature of the player is the \"Work Along\" mode. In this mode, the video plays in a small window while you're working in Lightroom. This lets you try the commands along with the video.\n\nVideo and audio quality is excellent. The 2 instructors do a great job. They don't get over technical and keep a good pace. Not only do they present the material, they also give examples of how they use a Lightroom feature or command in their own workflow.

You'll progress from the very beginning of setting Lightroom up to importing photos, developing them, exporting them and everything in between. It does not contain everything that anyone would want in an educational program - that would be a practical impossibility. However, this program contains 10 hours of video training: you hear how a procedure occurs and you see how it's done, along with advice and opinion. There's even a testing procedure included and reference booklet. You can also copy selected video tutorials. I've had and have been using Adobe Lightroom for a couple years and recently upgraded to Lightroom 3.

I love Photoshop but tend to spend a lot of time with it, so the supposed time-saving features of Lightroom would be helpful.\n\nI really hoped this product would make it easy for me to use Lightroom. Unfortunately I had trouble staying alert through more than 3 or 4 lessons at a time, and that much only covers a small portion of the material.  I don't think this is because of the presenters so much as it is the difficulty of covering this sort of material in a video format.\n\nThe Introduction alone consists of 26 videos. It seemed like a commercial for Lightroom rather than a tutorial. Seven of the lessons are devoted to \"What's New\" -- not too relevant for beginners. On the plus side, there were plenty of screen shots to familiarize us with the look of the software.\n\nUnit 2 has 11 video lessons on importing pictures.

In fact, finding the time to watch the entire ten hours at all might be difficult.  Don't be fooled though as any time you invest in going through this video will improve your usage of Lightroom.  It really depends on what you want out of Lightroom.  If you are just wanting some simple organization and editing you won't need this video or certainly won't need all of it.

But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.\n\nIf you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don't need this video.

I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.\n\nThere are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.\n\nThe focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the \"Classroom in a Book\" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.\n\nOne thing I got here more clearly than in the \"Classroom in a Book\" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).\n\nOverall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on \"Best Practices\" serves as a useful complement to the \"how to\" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the \"Next Video\" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the \"Next Video\" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. \"Hawaiin\" instead of \"Hawaiian\"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the \"inverseKinematics_start.fla\" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.</td><td>11 27, 2010</td><td>AGVWTYW0ULXHT</td><td>Nate</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on \"best practices\"</td><td>1290816000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.\n\nThe lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.\n\nAs with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.</td><td>10 21, 2010</td><td>A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</td><td>Grimmy</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A good introduction to Flash, with some UI weaknesses</td><td>1287619200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This certified associate courseware comes as a package containing a DVD-ROM plus supplemental written material.

It covers the very basics and this might be off-putting to people with experience using MS Windows.\nThe presentation voices are modulated and interesting. They are personable and the viewer gets an, \"in classroom,\" feel which improved the effectiveness of the lessons for me.  Some people learn better by working along with the instructor. This video course provides the necessary files to do this and complete the tutorial as it is watched.  The narrator leaves plenty of time for this.\n\nFor those who learn best by listening and watching the pace of presentation designed for working along with the presentation it will seem to move slowly.\nThe supplemental material is a good reference for after you have completed the video lesson.  The video creates a foundation of basic skills needed and the reference reinforces the lesson.  The materials are a good reference to use while one is using the program.\n\nAll in all I found this lesson to be a useful introduction to using Flash CS5. This course helped me to learn skills that I can use in web development. For people like myself who learn better, especially at the begining in with a presentation format this provides a faster route to getting foundation skills to build upon with reference texts.</td><td>10 10, 2010</td><td>A31N0XY2UTB25C</td><td>Stephanie Sullivan</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Learn Adobe Flash Professional CS5 by Video</td><td>1286668800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This was the first Learn by Video series course that I've used, and I'm very impressed with the production.

There's also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.\n\nAgain, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.). This is helpful if you want to view the videos and work hands-on on your computer, although the small screen would be difficult.  The DVD also includes a collection of asset files that correspond with the lessons.\n\nIf you are a visual learner or don't prefer thick technical books, then this video course would be a good low-cost alternative.

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.</td><td>10 29, 2015</td><td>A1MRPX3RM48T2I</td><td>Trenton Bennett</td><td>null</td><td>Times have changed</td><td>1446076800</td><td>true</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have this running on my Macbook Air and two HP laptops.

The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels.

There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.\n\nInstallation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.\n\nIn use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).</td><td>10 17, 2013</td><td>AHNHLGKIZ2N3B</td><td>D.

But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.\n\nSo imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).\n\nAnd to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.</td><td>10 16, 2013</td><td>A16QODENBJVUI1</td><td>Robert Moore</td><td>null</td><td>A kinder, gentler Microsoft</td><td>1381881600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>First let me say the updates that have occured in Office over the past few updates have been GREAT!

I really like using Outlook at home (I have my own domain name so it is kind of a necessity for me).\n\nThe whole \"cloud\" thing is concern.  There may be files that I will be willing to put there however while it may be more secure (from hackers) than my home computer the court decisions on data I've \"shared\" with other vendors may not have as strong of legal protection as my home hard disk.

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.\n\nAn added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.\n\nInstallation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.\n\nIt did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected.

In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.\n\nThere are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.\n\nPlease note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.\n\nHere are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n\n Likes:\n\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\n\n Rants & Irritants:\n\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n\n Installation:\n\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n\n SkyDrive:\n\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n\n Summary:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review.

This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email.  This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription.  I'm not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  It's just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there. (like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling.  If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.  There are many tutorials on the MS website to help you along.  I've used this software for years, and recommend it highly. I'm particularly fond of the Outlook mail program, and wouldn't get a version that doesn't include it.</td><td>09 29, 2013</td><td>AZZ5ASC403N74</td><td>Rose Blue</td><td>null</td><td>This is the premier office software</td><td>1380412800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>I'm not sure why so many people are having problems downloading and installing Microsoft Office 365. As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).\n\nThe new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\n\nAs far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\n\nOffice 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\n\nMicrosoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.</td><td>09 27, 2013</td><td>A4U27URFECK1U</td><td>The Technologist</td><td>null</td><td>A Lack Of Color Makes A Boring Interface</td><td>1380240000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>It's really hard to get any quantity of work down without Microsoft Office.

I actually had to uninstall then reinstall.  I also tried loading this to a Mac, same issues.  However, between the Win 8 attempt and the Mac install, I tried it on a Windows 7: everything installed like a dream.  I have no idea why this is fussy on some systems.

I use Office on my desktop computer for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, so there is no advantage here with Office 365.\n\nThe features of Office 365 are no better than before, but again Microsoft changed the layout of the menus and where everything is. It's not hard to figure out, but I would rather just buy a standalone product that I don't have to pay for over and over for minor improvements. If you have more than one computer and are on the road--or if you need the latest in Word updates, then you are the ideal customer for this product.</td><td>09 26, 2013</td><td>A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L</td><td>BumbleB</td><td>null</td><td>Not worth the money for 1 year sub</td><td>1380153600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is the standard for office suites as far as I an many others are concerned.

I did what I thought Microsoft wanted of me - downloaded the demo copy from them, and then entered the keycode. I now have a working copy, but did I just pay for the privilege?\n\nApart from that, this is the best way to buy Office. You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won't guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.\n\nI like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I'm used to things that people get upset about. For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don't like. I find it hard to recommend anything else, and as long as Microsoft keep offering this at a low price it's a no-brainer.\n\nAll I dislike about this is the installation problem I've mentioned.

For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive. From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).\n\nThe public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close. Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo. I would like to see one more choice: \"Direct Link,\" which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything.\n\nI've also installed Office 365 onto my wife's MacBook and her iPhone.

The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.\n\nThings glo has improved upon:\n\n++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.

I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.\n\n++  There is a \"Quick Install\" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.\n\n++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.\n\n++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.\n\nMany have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.\n\nThe initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.\n\nThis product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.\n\nThe best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a very good program.

I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.

Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.\n\nGLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.\n\nGLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.\n\nBe forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.\n\nThe one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.\n\nI'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.\n\nGLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you.

I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.\n\nAs a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.\n\nCheck out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.\n\nThis program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:\n\nAudible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.\n\nA few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.\n\nI wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.\n\nAnd, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.\n\nIn my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!\n\nThis program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.\n\nUPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop. Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app. I'm loving this on the IPod.</td><td>07 9, 2011</td><td>A1PI8VBCXXSGC7</td><td>Lynn</td><td>null</td><td>Interactive, Multi-media Bible  provides a wealth of information..Update: I just added Glo to my IPod Touch</td><td>1310169600</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>0982697813</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I got this installed on my computer, and it was almost overwhelming how much data and information that is presented.

Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive.  There are three DVD's in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1.  That's not too bad.  But if you want to do the \"full\" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.

This is a joint effort by those two powerhouse entities.\n\nFor the cost of admission this program will at the very least provide you with a set of decisions you will need to make when creating your will if not sufficient thoroughness in order to provided you with the actually final document itself.

Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.\n\nWillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.\n\nI wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my \"final intentions\" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say \"give it all to so-and-so\".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.\n\nI think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the \"list price\" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.\n\nBy the way, if you buy this toward the end of 2011, note that the \"free updates\" are only good through the end of December.</td><td>07 31, 2011</td><td>A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ</td><td>PhotoGraphics</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Not very sophisticated</td><td>1312070400</td><td>false</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>1413313701</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>This is the third version of Quicken Willmaker Plus I have used.  I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)\n\nThis 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.\n\nOther than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.\n\nFor most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.\n\nAnother thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.\n\nMost likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use.  I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.  But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, I'm going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community.</td><td>07 9, 2011</td><td>A5JLAU2ARJ0BO</td><td>Old-and-Wise</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Solid estate planning product, but living trust feature not integrated</td><td>1310169600</td><td>false</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>1413313701</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have to say that this software is great to save yourself a lot of legal fees.

I wanted to use this to update a new will, since my old one is about ten years old, but ended up just typing the new one in because my old form is much better for where I live.  If, however, you don't want to hire a lawyer and you don't know how to pull together every form you might need for end of life legal dispositions (will, health care directive, etc.) and you don't have a big or complicated life, this will do the trick nicely and save you a lot of money.

When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.\n\nMany of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.\n\nIncluded in the program are \"checklists\"  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as \"How to Form an LLC\" and \"How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting\".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.\n\nMost frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated \"Book Reader\" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, also included with the program is a printed book called \"Your Little Legal Companion\" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as \"Moving in with your Lover\" and \"Getting Old.\" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.\n\nUpon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book \"101 Law Forms for Personal Use\".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.\n\nCombined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.  However if you don't really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually.</td><td>01 8, 2011</td><td>A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE</td><td>Dave Greenbaum</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>A bunch of outdated eBooks in a confusing arrangement</td><td>1294444800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1413313728</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>As an owner of a small business, there are often times when I need a simple contract or legal document drafted up.

After installing and using it for a few weeks here are the pros and cons that I have come up with:\n\nPROS:\n- Simple and straightforward installation\n- Easy to use\n- Extensive collection of forms\n- While I haven't had the time to read it all, the Nolo business books is a great point of reference\n\nCONS:\n- fill-in process is required.  IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document.\n- no index of documents\n- could not find any way to export information to other file formats.\n\nOverall, this collection of forms and books presents a great value that can save you money on your first use, and I'd highly recommend it for other small business owners.</td><td>12 26, 2010</td><td>A16RI68PS6T5CA</td><td>Gadget Geek</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Do your own homework!</td><td>1293321600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1413313728</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The pre-made contracts and forms are a blessing in disguise.  They are certainly very useful to get you going and give you an idea of what you may need to have in an agreement on many issues, however, if it's something really serious I wouldn't blindly use the forms here but edit them very carefully or have a lawyer look at them for you.\n\nOne really good feature of this product are the fully sercheable books which is really nice to keyword something in and find as much information as you can.  You can google it too, however, you have to sort out a lot of useless information on Google, here, it's all organized and professional!\n\nAlso:  buying this instead of the books individually certainly saves you a bundle, so might as well get them like this, sercheable, than in print.</td><td>12 23, 2010</td><td>A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET</td><td>Robert</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Very useful</td><td>1293062400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1413313728</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Before reading on, please note that the newer, updated version (2012) is now available for less --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Quicken-Legal-Business-Pro-2012/dp/B005CELLZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Quicken Legal Business Pro 2012</a>. (Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)\n\nThat said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:\n\nFirst, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.\n\nI will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).\n\nAll of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.\n\nI don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.\n\nAlso, none of the forms were usable \"as-is\" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).\n\nNonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.</td><td>01 26, 2012</td><td>A1HOLE9R6WPT85</td><td>Mad Max</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Really for individuals & small business ...

The interface takes some getting used to, and the search engine leaves a bit to be desired.  The program can also be a little slow to respond, particularly when it first loads.

Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world.\nI am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.  You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image.  The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either.  I have several of these collections and cannot comment of how a first time user will find this.  There are better interfaces but this is not an impossible one and it is fully supported.\nIs it worth it?  That depends on you.  Can you lose yourself in looking at pictures of Europe in 1925?  Would you want to read about the Pacific Northwest in the 1930?  Can you spend a couple of hours looking at advertisement of products that no longer exist?

Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).\n\nNote that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!\n\nThe developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a \"copy everything to disk\" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now.

I also noticed that some of the translations are not 100% accurate.  For instance, the Spanish phrasing would obviously contain the words Madrid or Barcelona, but the English translations would not.  This kind of made me wonder why.\n\nBased primarily of the price point, I do recommend this program as a starting point for learning Spanish.  There are many other free resources online that you can use to supplement the course including translators, traveler cheat sheets and so on.</td><td>04 11, 2011</td><td>A2F2S1L61X1LA9</td><td>Bromptonboy</td><td>null</td><td>Worth the Price</td><td>1302480000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>1600775411</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Before ordering this product directly from Amazon, I did my homework by posting comments in the comments sections of the most popular Amazon reviewers who have purchased and reviewed this product and other popular Spanish learning software.  After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.\n\nMany people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.\n\nWithout a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.\n\nThe third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.\n\nThere is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.\n\nBut I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the \"vos\" (as opposed to \"vosotros\") is used instead of the \"tu\" form.\nOne of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.\n\nSome other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.\n\nTo speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.\n\nThe last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>.

The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they don't seem to update anything. I've used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version. The graphics are dated and unattractive. The videos/animation slow and not fluid. This looks like they took the same product they've been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate. I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing. That sounds are still hollow sounding as well and modern day clip-art looks more attractive. The games/learning tools are the same but not expanded. It doesn't look like they added new words or addressed much new material at all.\n\nI still think these are interesting to start with if you don't have an old version.

The program includes, in recommended order of use:\n\n1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases.

In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me. We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis.\n\nThis program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older!

It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject. Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:\n\nI received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.\n\nThere were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.\n\nI'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.\n\nIf you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that. Or if you just want a nice introduction to Spanish, to see if it's a language that you'd enjoy learning this product would also be excellent and the price is very reasonable.

The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).\n\nThe Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.\n\nIn its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.\n\nWhen you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's \"search\" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy \"Virtual Notecards\". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.\n\nThe new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.\n\nPerhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.\n\nRegrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.\n\nSpeaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.\n\nThe Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.\n\nThe Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.\n\nThe Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.\n\nThe Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the \"Personal Brain\" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.\n\nThe Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, \"how to\" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.\n\nIronically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).\n\nStill, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.\n\nThe current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.\n\nThe Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.\n\nSome minor gripes:\n\nThe atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?\n\nDespite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.\n\nBut that's it. Don't think twice.

This also may explain why the game is shorter; I'm guessing they realized that the game would be better if it took longer, so the other two games (\"Stay Tuned For Danger\" and \"Message In a Haunted Mansion\") have more playing time.  On the other hand, because it is shorter, it's also easier, so this might be better for slightly younger girls than the other two.  Also, this game requires 2 CDs--you have to switch back and forth.  This was annoying at first, but soon became bearable.  But really, this game was a lot of fun.  Even with the less-than-stellar graphics, there were still a lot of word puzzles and things to explore.  This game and \"Message\" both have slide puzzles, though, which I can't stand.

While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.\n\nThis game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of \"Light of Our Love\" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...\n\nThe plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.\n\nThe quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.\n\nSadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.\n\nThe graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).\n\nThe characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where \"Light of Our Love\" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of \"Light of Our Love\". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive \"suspects\". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.\n\nThe music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect \"New York City\" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.\n\nWhile Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, it's a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If you've played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please don't do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story that's worth experiencing. I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, here's to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!</td><td>05 25, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Stay Tuned for Improvement</td><td>1306281600</td><td>false</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>B00003IRBV</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>NOTE:I am posting this review on both product pages for this game since Amazon has the same game listed as two different products.\n\nAfter getting stuck on this game for a while, I had put it away to try later. After I tried it again and managed to finish it, this game quickly became one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. \"Stay Tuned for Danger\" may be one of the older games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also one of the best.\n\nStory-A soap opera star has called you to New York to figure out who is sending death threats to her co star. It soon becomes evident that someone is out to hurt or kill him as the threats elevate and some near fatal accidents occur. It is up to you to figure out who is causing it all.\n\nGraphics-Although the graphics are much better than the first game, they still aren't perfect. They are in 3D, and the 3D is done pretty well. The characters are also pretty good, but they tend to freeze in awkward positions as they are done talking, only resuming movement when they start to talk again. But, overall, the graphics are pretty good.\n\nSound-The music in the game is OK, but it really doesn't stand out as being catchy. The background sounds are good in the game, and the voice acting is good, too. Some of the voice actors sound like they were really into their parts while some sounded like they were bored.\n\nGameplay-This game, like all games in the Nancy Drew adventure series, is a first-person point-and-click game. You will move around between 3 main locations while solving puzzles, questioning suspects, and finding clues. The puzzles in this game are very innovative and may require some serious thought to solve them, but although they are a challenge, they are still really fun. In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them. You can also ask them for help which is a way to get hints for what to do next.\n\nLength-It's a pretty good-sized game. There's a lot to do throughout the game, and it's not necessarily very obvious what to do next. The game should probably last several hours at least.\n\nAll in all, this is probably one of the most challenging and fun games in the Nancy Drew series. It lasts a while, and it incorporates great adventure gaming elements into the gameplay.

These are my observations.\n\n1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.\n\n2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that \"just works\" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.\n\n3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.\n\n4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.\n\nWindows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and \"just works\". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.</td><td>09 23, 2006</td><td>A16UJ76AFPJGEX</td><td>B.

A lot of Microsoft staff was there. One quick note is that there were two types of staff. One wore red shirts, and the others wore blue shirts. The whole day seminar/presentation started with an explanation of, \"If you have a technical question, ask one of the Microsoft staff in a red shirt, if you have a sales or marketing question, ask a blue shirt\". I got a charge out of that. Sales people are enamored with what the software can do for you, and the technical staff is enamored in how it can do it.\n\nWhat I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesn't hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.\n\nWhat W2000 does is amazing. Not only can an outside manufacturer not be able to change system files, if you go in and delete a system file, then exit out of the folder, then go back in, sure enough the system file you just deleted was automatically restored when you exited out of the folder.\n\nAnother point I wanted to make; the overwhelming advantage of using W2000 over XP when installing in an older machine is that it is compatible with a lot of the older hardware.\n\n  Here is the problem: You install XP, and up comes a warning that your hardware is not compatible, or needs drivers loaded in order to work. The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility.\n\n XP is built on the Windows 2000 platform.\n\nI just built a new machine, so I installed XP Pro on it, and I also picked up a copy of W2000 from an independent seller here at Amazon, and loaded it on my AMD K62-500 for the network. Although I did have one video card that didn't have a W2000 driver, so I changed that very inexpensively with a great 128meg video card on sale with rebates for $29. So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time. You can leave a machine sitting for a couple of hours and not have it respond poorly when you come back to it, and have to reboot. No more blue screen error reports, having to reboot and run scan disk.\n\nOn my new XP machine, I had a bad program loaded, and when would run it, I would get a millisecond error screen, with an instant shut down, then it would reboot without having to run scan disk. I am assuming that since you can't mess with system files, no errors are created. I removed the program, which was a Mickey mouse add on included with a hardware bundle.\n\nWindows 2000 pro rocks.

In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.

For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from \"The Secret of the Old Clock\", with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.

This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!

I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait?

This is the hard part to Dramatica, since  ideal prior art probably doesn't exist, from which to refer,  except for the possibility of future works skilfully created with Dramatica.\nNow there's a chicken or the egg paradox.</td><td>10 29, 2003</td><td>A1PPD5TOR6VVYV</td><td>S Smyth</td><td>null</td><td>Ahead of the curve.</td><td>1067385600</td><td>false</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>B00004TYCR</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Dramatica is a way to organise your thoughts about theme, plot-theme, and characters into a story form as opposed to something that isn't.\nUsing its own terminology allied to templates, the user is required to fill in a set of questionnaires, which act as the input from which their story is distilled. This can be amended at will if the user feels that they are being too boxed in.\nThe end result is more easily managed than stacks of cards and papers. It can also be easily shared with other Dramatica users by distributing files across the internet to each other (given that version sync isn't an issue).\nIt's like having a collaborator in front of you all the time - if needed - with regard to the structure, but won't be of any help with poor prose, prose-style, bad dialogue, lack of motivation or any other essential aspects that the writer would need to know about. A badly written story, which is bang-on structurally, as far as Dramatica is concerned, is not  a useful end product. In other words, the user would need to be a decent writer in the first place, using Dramatica as a tool to refine and focus their work, and not regard it an easy way out. It's not.\nSo bearing that in mind, Dramatica shouldn't disappoint so long as  the user is prepared for the discipline of story writing, in its strictest sense.</td><td>08 20, 2003</td><td>A1PPD5TOR6VVYV</td><td>S Smyth</td><td>null</td><td>Very useful tool.</td><td>1061337600</td><td>false</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>B00004W62O</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great extension to the Windows 98 line of operating systems.

A really fun, exciting, game for girls -- that DOESN'T come in a pink box, for heaven's sake.  As a video game fan growing up in the 80s, I noticed that there were very few \"girl-oriented\" games out there.  There were plenty for boys; and a few for both sexes, like \"Tetris\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\", and, of course, the ever-popular \"Mario Bros.\" series.  But even the Mario games favored boys.  There were always more male characters to choose from than females (there'd be, maybe one girl, the Princess, who sported a pink dress.) And the games JUST for girls would be, like, Atari's \"Strawberry Shortcake\" game, where you'd get to switch around everybody's outfits.  Now, in the year 2001, there's plenty of girl software out there, but I'm not interested in PC Diaries, where girls can record their innermost secrets and keep them locked up with a voice-activated password.  I've outgrown being interested in designing clothes for Barbie.  (They need a game where you can design a Barbie house!  Now that would be cool.)  Not that there's anything wrong with those games; it's just that they're very tame, and some girls, like myself, want adventure.  Believe it or not, the box for this Nancy Drew game sports the phrase \"For adventurous girls, ages 10 and up.\"  That's me! (A bit over 10, but who's counting?)  But enough with the introductions -- let me describe the game.  It's an adventure game; \"Choose Your Own Adventure\"-esque.  Nancy is staying in a mansion that's someday going to be a Bed & Breakfast.  There's a problem though -- a bunch of accidents have been happening.  Your job, as Nancy, is to find clues, solve puzzles, talk to people, and solve the mystery of who's responsible for the accidents.  But you soon discover that you have a SECOND mystery to deal with.  This game requires logic, patience, and a curious mind.  What amazed me was how long the game took to complete; there's really a lot to do.  But after about 14-16 hours of game play, I have finished the game, and I'm sad.  So -- I think I'll order the other two Nancy Drew games that are on amazon! ;)  Please, DreamCatcher games and Her Interactive -- keep these coming!  I want more Nancy Drew games.  I've always loved the books; and fans of the books might even laugh at how closely the game resembles the books in some instances.

But I've learned not to pre-judge the older games; it's the plot and puzzles that drive these games, not the graphics. That said, this game was not mind-blowing. If you want to go for a classic Nancy Drew title, I would suggest the game that came after this, Treasure in the Royal Tower (#4). I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.\n\nI thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said \"20+ hours of gameplay\", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered \"educational\". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like \"Oh great, here comes another history lesson.\"\n\nCHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.\n\nThe graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.\n\nPhone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.\n\nSETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.\n\nPUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle \"in the corner\". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like \"Maybe you should take a look at the library again!\" it was more \"Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf.\" Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.\n\nENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 4\nCharacters: 3.5\nSetting: 4.5\nPuzzles: 4.5\nChallenge: 2.5\nEnding: 3.5\n= 22.5 divided by 6 = 3.75 rounded to 4 stars</td><td>06 11, 2013</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>The Message is Worth Reading</td><td>1370908800</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I think this game is when the company really got into it's groove.

I could still recite the games poem perfectly. \"Listen my child to this story of dreams...\" I loved that. I think I annoyed my mother with how many times I repeated back when I first received the game in 2001/2002.\n\nFor people looking to get into the series, I might recommend this to you, but make sure you get another game (preferably from the first eleven, if you want a true example of what this company can do) to accompany it.

This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal \"Nancy Drew case formula\". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as \"there must always be four suspects\" and \"there must always be a long-lost treasure\".\n\nRose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?\n\nThe plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first \"haunted house\" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.\n\nI will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.\n\nEven though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.\n\nThe graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.\n\nThe characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.\n\nOne wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.\n\nThe music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.\n\nMessage in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.</td><td>05 26, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>The Message: This Game Rocks!</td><td>1306368000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>After success with the first two games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, the creators tried to step up the suspense with a scarier mystery.  In \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.\n\nStory-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.\n\nGraphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.\n\nSound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.\n\nGameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.\n\nLength-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.\n\nOverall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE-There is also a version of this game available for the Game Boy Advance.</td><td>12 12, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Another good Nancy Drew game</td><td>1260576000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Message\" is the first Nancy Drew Pc game that I have tried and I was very favorably impressed. The game is literate: it is not directed towards very young players per se and young people will have to read well to appreciate the many tidbits of literature scattered around the Victorian mansion. I am 76 and could read them quite well. :)\n\nThe sets are beautifully rendered in elegant color and the Chinese antiques are a feast for the eye. The characters are well animated with gestures that are completely natural. The voices are good, too.\n\n\"Message\" is Nirvana for the Point and Click enthusiasts. No expert mouse maneuvers are required such as jumping into a fast moving bucket in \"Uru.\" Nothing is timed. We take our PC games very seriously and it is an affront to the ego when one isn't fast enough to perform an intricate mouse gyration. In fact, I could get stage fright just looking at a high ledge I knew I had to vault upon and therefore couldn't perforn at all.\n\n\"Message\" is scary. This is by no means a plain dish of vanilla. There are creaks and groans and shadowy forms passing in the night. Atmosphere plus. And you can wander around just as you wish poking into this and that and getting a delicious scary thrill when a curtain suddenly billows into your face with hissing sound.\n\nCaptions are provided which are very helpful as the characters speak rapidly. All in all \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" is a very solid piece of work for all ages.</td><td>07 21, 2006</td><td>A22F3BWM7RAHDA</td><td>P. B.

Is a ghost behind it all - as one of the owners believes, or is one of the hired help or even one of the owners to blame for all that's going on?  And if it's one of \"the living\", what reason do they have to cause all of this havoc?  Your job as Nancy Drew, teen detective will be to answer these questions, and get to the bottom of it.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed (or is enjoying) the Nancy Drew series.

Nancy is staying with a friend and helping her fix up a Victorian mansion that she is going to turn into a B&B, except strange accidents keep happening that delay the grand opening. Is the house really haunted?\nThe only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with \"Treasure in the Royal Tower.\" But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the sance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.\nThere are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me.\nOne of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really weren't many places to explore. You can't leave the house, and you only have access to your room and one other room, the attic, the dining room, parlor, and basement. I was hoping for more rooms/secret passageways to explore. Not having more locations really cut down on the game's length/replayability.\nOverall, \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" is a fun outing for detectives: a chance to explore a spooky haunted house, gather clues, learn about Chinese art and writing, and dig up clues about a timeless love story and hidden treasure.</td><td>04 6, 2003</td><td>A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</td><td>Bundt Lust</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Fun, but confusing</td><td>1049587200</td><td>false</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>B000050ZRE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am very satisfied with the purchase of this wireless router.\nThe setup took just a few minutes to complete the setup wizard and after that everything worked from the first time, perfectly.\nI have now wireless connectivity throughout the whole house.

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This \"smart-switch\" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.\n\nDesign:\nOne of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.\n\nThe click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.\n\nThe 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.\n\nThe 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.\n\nThe interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no \"power brick\" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.\n\nThe included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.\n\nConfiguration:\nI downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.\n\n' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.\n' Change the password - The default password is \"password\", so change it to something better!\n\nThe Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.\n\nThe advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:\n' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)\n' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)\n' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).\n' Port by port Rate limiting\n' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a \"disable\" setting to turn a port off if desired)\n' Port by port Broadcast Filtering\n' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)\n' Multicast control via IGMP snooping\n' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)\n\nNote: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n\nMost users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n\nGreen Power Use:\nThe 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n\nSupport:\nI did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n\nThe switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n\nI had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.\n\nI'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.\n\nHope this helps someone!</td><td>04 21, 2015</td><td>A31N0XY2UTB25C</td><td>Stephanie Sullivan</td><td>List( 0.4243608529, null, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Outstanding DESIGN, Feature RICH, Easily MANAGED, Great SUPPORT, GREEN</td><td>1429574400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000050ZRE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Item came quickly, exactly as described, and a great price.\nWay cheaper from this seller than other places online.\nEasy to add modules makes this switch extremely flexible and future-proof</td><td>04 21, 2015</td><td>A3RK4C2I5SPZNO</td><td>JayB</td><td>List( 0.0811504547, null, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>and a great price.

I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n\nInstallation\n\nYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n\nHardware\n\nAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n\nThe array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n\nOne HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n\nI did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n\nA nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n\nDuring my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.</td><td>03 26, 2012</td><td>A2UL0DVTM8KVNV</td><td>R.

I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.

Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.\n\nI have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.

This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says \"T7Hub\" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for \"permanent\" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.

If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.</td><td>12 19, 2007</td><td>A37VWMG8U0OP41</td><td>Eric Thorson</td><td>List( 0.0986190179, null, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Expensive but worth it for my uses!</td><td>1198022400</td><td>true</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>B000050ZRE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Easy to install on XP machine, drivers worked great.\n\nLoaded quickly and easily, and worked!\n\nWhat else could you ask for?</td><td>11 21, 2007</td><td>A2E6P8E66HNRRC</td><td>R.

I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.\n\nThat device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).\n\nI wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.\n\nA bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.\n\nSetup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).\n\nAnother bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.\n\nThe downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive \"ethernet to Wi-Fi\" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.\n\nThe PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang \"g\") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps \"turbo\" mode in 802.11a!

I had some very weird things happen with 2000 such as its not publishing to the web on the index page unless I also saved it in Notepad.  All the bugs are gone in 2002 plus it is much easier to use.  I use it for everything, rarely using Word, Office and so forth.  My two major tools for editing and writing are Front Page and super Notepad instead.  I am going to learn Dreamweaver next term at the college where I teach because I am finally ready to move on and learn more about professional  web design.  Besides, I can now read and write html so I am not as utterly dependent on Front Page as I once was.  If you don't know any html coding, the basis of all web pages, Front Page is the program for you.  I also do all my image editing in Photoshop so don't even need that function in Front Page.  Dreamweaver is the industry standard instead of Front Page yet Front Page is the ordinary user's program of choice.  The reason for this is that you can know very little about computers and still make a website with Front Page.  It even made publishing websites idiot proof by using Front Page Server extensions with many web host providers.  Thus, one can totally skip learning ftp protocol by using Front Page server extensions instead.  If someone wants to go professionally into web page design, this is not the product, Dreamweaver is.  People who already are professionals in the computer industry or in web design tell me they don't like Front Page.  I think the reason is that since they don't need (or want) Front Page to do their work for them, they desire a program which gives them a much freer hand.  For the average computer user though, that is all pie in the sky, beyond their reach, and Front Page 2002 will more than do the job for them.</td><td>11 28, 2002</td><td>AW3VZ5O895LRK</td><td>carol irvin</td><td>null</td><td>Huge Improvement Over 2000</td><td>1038441600</td><td>false</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>B00005AFI2</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft.

It behaved as if I had never unloaded it the first time.  My alloted number of uses (before activation) decreased so something is still in there saying it was on there before (yes, yes, yes...in the registry).  Ok, Bill wants a new mansion so he is trying to prevent piracy.  I can understand that.  HOWEVER, my next concern is realllllyyy big.  In ME, you can set a restore point.  This restore point allows you to reconfigure your PC to a point from the past.  This is present just in case a new program you load has some problems, etc....  Now remember, ME is Mr. Gate's program just like Publisher.  I had to reformat my hard drive (thanks to Microsoft's Encarta Reference Library).  My system was fresh as a daisy.  I re-loaded Publisher out of curiosity to see what would happen.  I created a restore point PRIOR to loading it.  I didn't activate it because I didn't want it.  I unloaded it.  Just to test the system, I used my restore function.  If you are following me carefully, you can tell I have already made two changes since creating the restore point:  loading and unloading Publisher.  Guess What!?!  ME wouldn't allow the restoration because NOTHING HAD CHANGED ON MY PC!  HELLO???  I loaded and unloaded a program; I consider that a change.  Let's say Publisher had a problem and didn't work.  In order to get it off my PC, I would have to do ANOTHER format for my hard drive.  That, my friends, is scary.  And to add on to another person's review.  That person was incorrect when he/she said you could only have it on two PC's and would be out of luck if one crashed.

This time, Nancy Drew is snowed in at a modern-day castle in Wisconsin. She'll meet some strange people, sneak through creepy secret passages, and find beautiful trinkets and treasures ... not without the usual dangers, of course... Nancy Drew can't really avoid those.  There will always be an evil villain trying to do her in.  But hey, it's all in good fun.  If you've played the other Nancy Drew games, this is more of the same.  Most similar to \"Message In A Haunted Mansion\" (in my opinion), this game offers puzzles that are similar to puzzles in the first 3 games, but with one or two totally original ones.  Other than a few surprises, there's nothing in here that's really superior to the other games; I'd say they are all pretty equal.  Still, another Nancy Drew adventure is a good time waiting to happen.  It took me about 12 hours to complete on the junior level, though the box claims it can take you 20.

She is on the trail of a missing journal of Marie Antoinette's that would lead to a sacred treasure hidden by the ill-fated queen back in the 18th century. Her sanctuary was the Chteau Rochemont in France relocated & rebuilt by a chocolate milk tycoon in America.  I found it generally interesting to be able to explore the monstrosity that was the castle, but later became irritated by the tasks that had me zipping all over the place with a clunky interface.\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 88\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nDexter Egan: This was one of the more interesting characters that HER has ever produced as it showed the light and dark side of a man growing up as an adopted child by the millionaire, Ezra Wickford. Ezra had such affection for the boy Dexter [spelling bee champion, volunteer work during WW2 era]  until he felt he could no longer trust him with his future estate based on criminal fraud convictions. Great plot line and I loved the two journals in the secret study!\n\nJacques Brunais: He was sappy right from the start! I was very surprised that HER had the character end relations with Nancy on such a horrible note, but I actually LIKED that story derivative!  It showed the live emotions of irrational people [like in real life].\n\nLisa Ostrum: Usually when a shady past is shoved in your face early in the storyline, that is a sign that this isn't the culprit.  I had Lisa pegged as my # 1 suspect only because the other characters were pressed into showing their flaws throughout the adventure too thoroughly and I had reasons to think they HAD problems, but they weren't directly related to the vandalism. Tara V. Smith [who voiced Lisa] did a fine job, but it sounded rather cartoonish also [like a Peanuts character] and I found it hard to take this photojournalist seriously.\n\nProfessor Beatrice Hotchkiss: God, this woman was something else. I loved the HER comedy bit with the fifty chicken legs and probably would never had done most of  the chores she asked out of shock she would ever impose this on me.  I doubt I would have been so forthcoming with her as the ND did, because she was just as much a suspect as anyone else there.\n\nNed/Bess/George: The voice actors [Claire Gallagher & Maureen Nelson] sounded like they were reading scripts because half of the dialogue didn't flow naturally, but the written dialogue did make me laugh.  Lani Minella actually laughed in this one which is a rare event in ND games. You can check her talent out on a youtube video I recently found! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm1BGVfqWC0\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nThe score was an excellent rendition of a classic, upscale French Society in the Age Of Reason.  It's light, lilting works trickled along amidst fine backings from harpsichords & strings.  The sound effects were adequate and the castle scenery was a solid job by the designers for the year it was made.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 88\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I didn't find many in the game except locker combinations, lever & slider puzzles, but it was okay for what the game provided. Uniqueness and mini games would come in later ND editions.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: The way the culprit was caught was rather odd and unsatisfactory. I was confused on what exactly happened and scoffed at the simple and unexplainable way I had to catch them. Perhaps some French punishment should have been introduced :) instead. The climax in the Royal Tower was spectacular on a visual level and again you had to pay close attention to Nancy's notes regarding what happened to everyone in the conclusion.  BTW: How is Nancy able to bounce around the castle in a good mood after being knocked unconscious hours earlier? Seems rather ridiculous to me.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me two days [7 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 82\n\nMy Strong Points: I guessed the culprit and have been on quite a run lately [14 correct out of 21 games]. I seemed to assimilate into the plot pretty well without being fooled into believing any side story that would skew my detective work. The puzzles were simple to complete and I noticed that similar puzzles were placed in later games.  I was able to deduce that I had to start the ski lift in order to be saved from the cold weather!\n\nMy Weak Points: A walkthrough was used only a couple times just to check my game flow because HER had a sloppy time integrating the \"incident trigger tree\" properly.  In layman's terms, I completed tasks a couple hours ahead due to my prowess only to find out later that the character was still wondering how to do the SAME events just accomplished by asking other people!\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 86 + 82/ 2 = 84 [ B ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I saw more written dialogue glitches [Bess [I believe] said \"someting\" instead of someTHING]. Overall, I learned only a bit more French history than I knew already, but for children, this is a fine starter education of European society.  I recommend it for that, but compared to the future games, it was rather simplistic.\n\nThus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, TREASURE ranks.... # 5 !!!!!\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5\n2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87\n3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5\n5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER  * 84\n6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 83\n7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5\n8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78\n11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77\n13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76\n14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72\n15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5\n16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71\n17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5\n18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70\n19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5\n20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69\n21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68</td><td>09 17, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>null</td><td>FRENCH DIAMOND OF A STORYLINE [YET ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES]</td><td>1410912000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I might be biased about this game because it was the first I ever played (and the first I ever finished -- since, when I started playing, I had all of the first five that I was flipping between, and six and seven came out very close on the heels of them, so I didn't actually finish any until a while after I'd received them).\n\nHowever, biases aside, this game still holds as my all-time favorite. I will admit it isn't the best game in the series, but that's ok by me. It isn't extremely difficult, but it isn't overly easy. The characters are all interesting (and this game introduces my favorite ND character, Professor Hotchkiss). I love history, and this game is full of that. But the best part about it? The exploring. I will admit that the movements are a little bit limited, but this is only the fourth game. They hadn't yet refined things. However, in this game, every time you progress (almost) you get to unlock a new area in the game. There are so many places to go in this little castle, so many things to see.  This game gave me so much to imagine, so much to think on, and, now that I'm older, it gives me a ton of inspiration.\n\nTo anyone that hasn't played this game, I highly recommend it. If you've played other games but not this one, I'm completely shocked. You need to play this game NOW. And if you're looking for an introduction to the series, look no further. Treasure in a Royal Tower is a wonderful classic that I really hope will enthrall you as much as it has me these last ten years.</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>null</td><td>My favorite Nancy Drew game.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>With certain recent games like WAC and SAW, it's evident that with each and every Nancy Drew PC release, the graphics and voice acting get better and better. But sometimes, no matter how good the graphics are, they usually can't hide an empty storyline and a game in need of many touch ups. This game is an example of a decent edition to the series, and even though it's not one of my favorites, it doesn't need \"makeup\" to make it shine.\n\nStory: 8.5/10. This game has a decent story that holds together pretty well. Much of the game centers around centuries old history, much of it on Marie Antoinette. Although you ended up learning a few things, the story was still very inticing and it wasn't like they were shoving all of the information down your throat.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 8/10. I'm not going to rate a lot of this game on graphics, mainly because the graphics of today are automatically compared to these graphics, and considering this game and the new games were released a decade apart, I think it's fair to somewhat disregard the graphics. I liked the setting, even though you stay in one place, and I like moving around more. But this castle was ginormous, and I had plenty of trouble just finding my room.\n\nCharacters: 8/10. The characters this time all have pretty stand-out personalities. You have Dexter Egan, the caretaker of the building, Professor Hotchkiss, a hilarious if not somewhat annoying author who can never get Nancy's name right, Lisa, a photojournalist, and Jacques Brunais, a french ski intructor. They all have a distinct personality, and are a great touch to the overall atmosphere.\n\nPuzzles: 7.5/10. They're weren't that many puzzles, but the ones that were there were hard, but they fit the game.\n\nExploration: 9/10. Exploring is a big part of this game, and I got lost a lot. The castle is so big, and there's plenty for you to explore and have an adventure in.\n\nActivities: 4/10. Activities weren't really evident in the older games, and they're weren't any here either.\n\nEnding: 6.5/10. The ending was somewhat not surprising, and a pretty simple one too, yet it still gave me the goosebumps that good Nancy Drew PC endings give me. You people know what I mean.\n\nTotal (averaged): 7.3 out of 10, rounded to....\n\n7.5/10.\n\nAs a diehard Nancy Drew PC fan, I did enjoy this game, and it deserves a spot on any fan's shelf.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>null</td><td>Treasure in the Royal Tower review.</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>With each passing Nancy Drew game, the games have gotten better. In the past three alone, they've gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.\n\nNancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...\n\nThis is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (\"fictional\" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little \"toned down\" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).\n\nLike the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.\n\nWhile the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.\n\nThe cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her \"theory\" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).\n\nLike the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.\n\nThe game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall \"castle\" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically \"royal\", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.\n\nWhile the previous game is a close runner-up, \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that it's still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\" and \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\". Between the rich sense of history, awesome casting, wonderfully detailed settings, and great soundtrack, this surely remains one of Nan's most memorable cases to date.

I'd seen really good reviews for this game, but I was still kind of apprehensive because it's such an old game, I thought the graphics would be really horrible. But I was surprised at what a quality game it is! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 4.5/5: Nancy's ski vacation is cut short when a blizzard keeps her stuck in the Wisconsin castle she's staying at. Apparently in the 1920's, some guy who really loved French castles decided to build one in Wisconsin, and even imported a tower from Marie Antoinette's castle to be added on to his. Nancy learns that Marie Antoinette was rumored to have left a treasure somewhere in the castle, so it's up to her to find the treasure before someone else tears the castle apart trying to find it. I thought this was a really good plot, and everything else into the story tied into it nicely. I only wish it had been longer, it was a little shorter than I had hoped. But overall, I was impressed!\n\nCHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The characters include the castle's caretaker, Dexter, who is very defensive and has a dark past, and Jacques, a famous French skier who was actually really fun to listen to. The hotel's guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so I'm going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.\n\nSETTING - 5/5: I loved the castle!! It was huge, I got lost plenty of times just trying to find my hotel room, haha. But there was tons to explore. Plus I was surprised how good the graphics were. I thought they might be kind of shabby because it's an older game, but I was way off. And the music was really nice, some of the best music I've heard in a Nancy Drew game.\n\nPUZZLES - 3/5: I felt there was a serious lack of puzzles in this game. Maybe this came out before Her Interactive got the idea of putting in \"filler puzzles\" to make the games longer. It was kind of nice not having to do a puzzle every second, but I do want to have SOME puzzles. There were probably less than a handfull of puzzles in the whole game, wich must have been why it was so short.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING?: No. Like I said before theres only a few puzzles, and everything else is pretty easy. I'd give it a 2 for challenge.\n\nENDING - 5/5: The ending was good. It made perfect sense with the rest of the plot. The culprit isn't a surprise, but catching them was fun.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 4.5\nCharacters: 3.5\nSetting: 5\nPuzzles: 3\nChallenge: 2\nEnding: 5\n= 23 divided by 6 = 3.8 rounded to 4.</td><td>09 19, 2010</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>null</td><td>A Classic ND Treasure</td><td>1284854400</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This was, personally, the first Nancy Drew game that I ever played, and because of it, I am now hooked on the series and buy each new one that comes out.  I am very happy that this was my first game, as it is not only, in my opinion, one of the best games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also the perfect mix of mystery and intrigue.\n\nStory-You are on a ski vacation in Wisconsin when you get snowed in at the castle/resort in which you are staying.  You find out that the castle library has been vandalized, and you set out to find out who destroyed the beautiful library and why.  As you make your way through the game, you will also find that the story has quite a bit to do with the history of Marie Antoinette.\n\nGraphics-The graphics are improved from the earlier three games, as the 3D backgrounds have a bit more detail.  Also, the characters have been developed to move a bit more smoothly.\n\nSound-The music in the game is very regal and pleasant to listen to.  The background sounds are also well done as they sound realistic.  As for the voice acting, this game has some actors/actresses that sound really good and interesting.\n\nGameplay-First of all, like the games before it in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  Although there is only one main location to explore (the castle) it is a very large location filled with many rooms to explore and many puzzles to solve.  The puzzles range from easy to hard, but they are all solvable without any need of a walkthrough.  The hint system is there for you, if you need it though, which basically consists of calling your friends on the phone to ask for a hint.  There are also four characters that you can interact with and interrogate, and they each have a unique and interesting personality.\n\nLength-This is definitely a game with some meat to it length-wise.  It will take you several hours to finish it, and hopefully, you will have fun with every second of it.\n\nIf you're looking for an intriguing adventure game with fun puzzles and a great story, then this is the perfect game for you!</td><td>12 12, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>null</td><td>A perfect game in the series</td><td>1260576000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Imagine this: you're snowbound in a fancy Wiconsin hotel where you're supposed to be on a ski vacation.

Out of the four games I've played (\"Final Scene,\" \"Secrets Can Kill,\" \"Message in a Haunted Mansion, \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\"), \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore.\nNancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinette's name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.\nThe locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesn't want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy!\nBuyer Beware:\nI *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of \"Invalid CHUNK file.\" I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well. There is no patch available on HerInteractive's website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didn't go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldn't let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time.

It LOOKS a lot better than windows 2000 and other previous versions, and also it seems to load a lot faster than windows 2000. Which warrants my 2 star rating.\nThe new set up in Windows XP is very cumbersome and sometimes downright confusing.  For those of us that are familiar with Win 2K you will find that many things are not in places where we are used to them being.  This is a small problem and im sure that I will become comfortable with it.  My main gripe is the constant application lock ups in this OS for no apparant reason.  For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer, then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again.  Same goes true for Outlook.  Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out, or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows.  Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday.  Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason.  To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating \"sorry for the inconvience\" and an option to send the error report to microsoft. HA!  It looks like Microsoft expected this OS to have a lot of problems (and that it does) and are using the customers to find all their bugs for them.  I wouldn't mind doing this for a pay check, but for free?  I don't think so.\nI've only used XP for 4 days and already having a multitude of problems with constant lock ups and crashes.  I haven't had the oppurtunity to do software installations on this OS, and frankly I don't want to, im sure that is also littered with bugs.

When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.\nWindows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.\nThis is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.\nThe acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)\nI've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.\nAs with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.\nI will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:\n* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever\n* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start\n* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP\n* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically\n* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP\n* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.\n* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.\nAnd simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.\nIn terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.\nI think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.\nRecommended</td><td>01 21, 2003</td><td>A1YK56DPXS5DFX</td><td>Carlos Santiago</td><td>null</td><td>A solid operating system</td><td>1043107200</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00005MOTH</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>If you have Windows ME, you will want to upgrade (ME being one of the most annoying operating systems ever from Microsoft.)

I also run this on a laptop (Toshiba Satellite) and the power management feature for dimming the screen and managing the battery is welcome, as the Toshiba battery uptime is a bit limited.

Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is \"awesome\", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The \"start menu\", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the \"start menu\" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, \"ME\" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. \"KODAK\". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home.

In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.\nInstallation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.\nOnce installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a \"classic\" Windows 9x view.\nWindows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party \"usage tracking\" cookies that are placed on your PC.\nBackward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that \"DOS EMULATORS\" will be available for purchase in the near future.\nWindows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.\nFor those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.\nFor those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.\nThere is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself.

OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it.

Your sound card vendor may have stopped making software drivers a long time ago for your now discontinued device. The problem is that they do not want to spend the resources to create drivers for a product that they no longer make. So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly won't work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP. You might wind up spending close to the same amount of money upgrading your components to make it work, as you would to just simply buy a new one.

The \"start menu\", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the \"start menu\" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, \"ME\" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. \"KODAK\". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home. It all depends on the user and the environment, as simple as that.</td><td>01 19, 2002</td><td>A15S4XW3CRISZ5</td><td>Andre Da Costa</td><td>null</td><td>Windows XP Professional (Depends)</td><td>1011398400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005MOTG</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Perhaps I've become so jaded that all Windows systems now look the same.\nI'm ashamed to say just what was the first version of Windows I used but I will go on record stating that I have owned Windows 95, 98, ME and now XP.\nAs it is an Upgrade, I suppose that's why there is no significant difference once I get going.

I takes A L-O-N-G time to do the install (a single cd, yet prepare to spend about 2 hours once you hit \"go\").\nMOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER....\nIf you do nothing else to prepare for the upgrade; take the time to run the hardware & software compatibility check before you commit yourself to the install.  This is most critical & here's a good example.  The driver for my PC's modem/chipset was incompatible with XP.  This was highlighted when I ran the test and it allowed me to retrieve the updated driver before launching the upgrade.  If I had not done this, then I would have been toast.  After the upgrade I would not have been able to use my modem to access the internet to get the new driver after the fact.  So do yourself a favor, run the test, print it out, get all your patches beforehand & you'll save yourself a ton of frustration and wasted time.\nOther than that it's great and very easy to load.

If you're thinking about using this upgrade version, let me warn you of two things:  (1) You need to check all of your software to see if it's compatible with XP (there is a checking-program on this disc, but you can also download it from Microsoft's website to see which software you have is not compatible).  Even after I checked compatibility, some programs I had were non-functioning after the upgrade and some I had to install again.  (2) Download the most recent drivers for all your hardware to avoid problems.  I didn't do this and when I upgraded, I lost my sound card drivers because they weren't compatible with XP and the XP disc didn't have the new drivers I needed to make my sound card work, so I had to find my sound card manufacturer's website and download an XP compatible driver.\nYou are really better off waiting until you buy a new computer to get XP.  But, if you just can't wait and want to do this upgrade, make sure you do your homework to avoid some headaches during and after installation.

The new \"BSOD\", or blue screen of death, is now more of a \"grey hiccup of aggravation\".  After a crash, a little grey box pops up and says \"you have chosen to end a non-responsive program.  Would you like to send an error report to MS?\"  I must see this box 2-3 times a day, no kidding.  When it really has a processor brain-freeze, it just completely reboots, w/o warning.  These things are a normal occurrence for me. This is on a clean install, up-to-date system.  I've seen it with other systems as well.  Many of my friends hate XP for this reason, but I've learned to live with it, just as I did with all its predecessors.  Other than that, I really like a lot of the other features, and pretty much all the new toys and MS add-ins are XP-only, so it's worth the upgrade, (if nothing else), to avoid becoming obsolete.  It just gets my goat that many people are constantly touting how stable it is, and I routinely see otherwise.

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.\nThe Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the \"old computer,\" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).\nInstallation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.\nUsing XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the \"clear type\" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a \"normal\" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).\nI'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).

You will be amazed on how many third party \"usage tracking\" cookies that are placed on your PC.\nBackward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didn't work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that \"DOS EMULATORS\" will be available for purchase in the near future.\nWindows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.\nFor those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.\nFor those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.\nThere is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.</td><td>10 29, 2001</td><td>A3H4TIVTTA5IBB</td><td>Brian A.

Because when people used to have computer problems with Windows 95,98, and ME, I was always first on everyone's list to come fix their computer problems.  It was fun at first, but then I was really sick of it.  When XP came out, I recommended to all those people to get XP.  Now, NO ONE has called me since with a computer problem.  That shows you how wonderful this operating system is.  XP is not perfect; but it works well enough to keep the average computer user happy with the condition of their computer. It is virtually idiot proof and it is very difficult to 'mess it up'.  The system restore function is a big plus.  Also, Windows XP keeps your system files from being corrupted by viruses by not allowing unauthorized access to the files.  I'm not saying that it's virus-proof, but much more secure than previous Windows versions.  The only downside to XP is that some computer games don't seem to work good with it unless they were made compatible with XP.</td><td>06 12, 2003</td><td>AVYMBTCXYREXE</td><td>Batmanbrb</td><td>null</td><td>The Best of Microsoft's Operating Systems To Date...</td><td>1055376000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005MOTF</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Microsoft finally got it right with Windows XP (Home Edition).  Based upon the highly reliable Windows NT, XP is a stable, reliable, and thoroughly functional operating system that cures most of the flaws that earlier versions of Windows are known for.\nFirst and foremost, the \"Blue Screen of Death\" is gone!  I run XP on three computers in my home via a home network, and I have literally never seen the dreaded Blue Screen.  While both Windows 98 (which I thought was a pretty good OS) and Windows ME (horrible!!!) require frequent re-booting, XP does not.  You can go weeks, even months, without rebooting XP.  It is stable and reliable.\nSpeaking of home networks, XP Home Edition does a very good job if you want to set up a peer-to-peer network in your home.  We run one notebook (via a wireless connection base station hub) and two desktops via XP, and you can literally set something like this up in less than an hour, counting hardware hookups.  The Networking Wizard actually works, and takes almost all of the pain out of setting up a network.  If you want a peer-to-peer home network, XP is for you.\nOne warning--XP does not support a domain (server) network.  If you are interested in this sort of configuration you want Windows Professional Edition.  You cannot use XP for this.\nWindows XP is well-supported as regards various peripheral devices.  When I upgraded, I had no difficulty downloading the necessary drivers for my three printers, one scanner, and various other devices.  Most worked OK out of the box, but upgraded drivers are available from most vendors via the internet.\nSpeaking of the Internet, XP is truly dependent upon the Internet, and I would imagine that a user without Internet access would find XP very difficult to use.  XP is among the new generation of software of which Internet access is an integral design assumption.  The OS uses the Internet to register itself, obtain updates, and obtain drivers.  This is reflective of a trend whereby in my opinion every computer installation will in a very real way have as its centerpiece the Internet connection of the user.  Dial-up's days are numbered too--XP files, like most files nowadays, are simply too large for a 56K dial-up modem.\nIn my opinion Microsoft hit a home run with Windows XP, almost enough to cause me to forgive them for Windows ME, which was absolutely awful.  If you are using ME, RUN, don't walk, to upgrade.</td><td>06 4, 2003</td><td>A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</td><td>Roger J.

I've also used an OS 9 and 10 Mac.  None of them matches Windows XP.  It is simply the best, hands down.  I even like it better for using Photoshop and Illustrator than a Mac and that statement is virtually heresy in the art world! First, it is not buggy and not crash prone.  It reliably works all of the time.  Windows 2000 was very good in that regard and XP is even better. 95 and 98 were terrible regarding crashes and reliability. I'm also using Windows Media Player 9 with it, which is a terrific player, and I'm even able to use all wma files (1/3 the size) rather than mp3 after using a converter. I stopped using Real Player after getting on this Player 9, which works the best with XP.  Second, if I need help on something on my computer, I can have my friend in a different city, also on XP, take over my controls using the Net Meeting feature.  He was able to reinstall a program for me that was giving me fits.  Third, there are loads of special programs that work especially in conjunction with XP that further enhance it, such as Firegraphic 5 where you can see all your images and view them in filmstrips, slide shows and big versions. And that's just one of many special programs that I've used on XP.  It is also a delight to go to any website and find that whatever you can download there is compatible with XP.  One thing that would really turn me off a Mac, by contrast, is the notice on many programs or features on the web that they haven't developed a version yet for a Mac.  I also like the way Windows Explorer works in XP and that it looks better than in any earlier version of Windows.  As my giant file cabinet, it is very easy for me to keep everything organized in WE and the thumbnails of my jpgs, tifs, ais, htms and so forth are terrific.  The task bar is much improved from 2000 and I found I could even get rid of my pop up remover program because XP makes it so easy to close multiple browser windows with one right click on the task bar on a grouped browser window button. I also get beautiful thumbnails now when I use right click.  There is a wonderful XP magazine that comes from the UK (called simply Windows XP) that I would love to see Amazon have available for subscription.

What is with those cinnabar handprints and why is she in another mystery!?? Can't a girl catch a break?\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 83\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nJoanna Riggs: The original curator of the museum that is hanging on to her job after indiscriminate past dealings with finding rare artifacts.  She is hard-nosed with things running correctly and I found her type pretty typical in this career position.  I don't feel she is as moral as she wants to seem, but since she isn't bothering me, I overlook that for the most part.  I never considered her a culprit.\n\nHenrik van der Hune: A epigrapher that took a tumble on the indoor temple steps. I had to help restore his memory and always felt he was both a straight-laced boring personality to an outright professional in his career.  I never thought he could be the culprit.\n\nTaylor Sinclair: An art dealer in close connection with Johanna. This is the epitome of the sleazy criminal look with the thin mustache, shallow chin, and greasy hair. I didn't know if HER was putting up a facade with an obvious guilty caricature so I was 50/50 in my decision.\n\nAlejandro del Rio:  The U.S. ambassador to the mexican  consulate; he seems firm on righting wrongs that have taken precious artifacts out of the hands of his home country. He was my top option as the culprit because he seemed too handsome and proper somehow for the anger that could be felt beneath his demeanor.\n\nBESS/GEORGE/HARDY BOYS PHONE CONTACTS:  The girls were entertaining as always, but there was only so much they could actually help me with; same for the boys but on an even lesser level.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 82\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\n\nThe music was pretty uptempo and brought one into the mysteries of the Mayan culture.  Graphics were pristine for that early game design period.  Out in the museum garden, those bird noises were pretty unique. Was that a crested Guan?\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 84\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The three levels of the Mayan temple reserved for fill-in answer quizzes, basket hoop throwing, and the BUL game, kept my interest for the time being, but they were't challenges that you would describe as overly fascinating. The audio translation match was intriguing because it also helped you learn about the Mayans throughout the entirety of the museum which gave this particular adventure more of a \"learning series\" edge.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 85\n\nGENERAL IOTAS: I wouldn't call that corpse in the monolith a mummy [aren't those properly prepared?].  Why was a missing part of the escape challenge in the Whisperer's mouth? Doesn't make sense.  Also, why was the culprit using that scarlet hand imprint? I never got any explanation of why that was significant.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: I read too much into how tricky HER might be in this adventure, but it turned out \"not that much\". Why were all three of the innocent characters awaiting me as I exited the monolith? That was a weird situation in which I would want some answers on how this came to be.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days [12 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 62\n\nMy Strong Points: My memory was pretty impressive by memorizing the facts of Mayan culture meant for the quizzes and my adeptness at puzzling the pottery and key parts together was there.\n\nMy Weak Points: To save on time, I used a walkthrough only to bridge me from one part of the plot to another without delay. Um, I used this a LOT.\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 62/ 2 = 73 [ C - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I was pretty bored I must admit, but not because the game was poorly designed. I think that anything that has a setting being museum-focused is bound to make me stare out the window wanting for better days.  This comes in at average overall entertainment with very interesting highlights towards the end.\n\nThus far, on my list of the 26 completed ND games, SCARLET ranks.... # 16 !!!!!\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 90\n2) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 87\n3) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 86\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.5\n5) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 83.5\n6) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER  * 82.5\n7) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 82\n8) SECRET OF OLD CLOCK  * 81.5\n9) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY  * 80\n11) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 79.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 78\n13) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE  * 77.5\n14) LEGEND OF CRYSTAL SKULL  * 77\n15) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 75.5\n16) SECRET OF SCARLET HAND  * 73\n17) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 72.5\n18) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 72\n19) THE SILENT SPY  * 71.5\n20) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 71\n21) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 70.5\n22) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 70\n23) LABYRINTH OF LIES  * 69.5\n24) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 69\n25) RANSOM SEVEN SHIPS  * 68.5\n26) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 66.5</td><td>11 21, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>null</td><td>YOU CAUGHT ME RED-HANDED!

I don't know why, but I always just assumed that I wouldn't like this game. Maybe it's because it's notoriously educational (and who wants a game that is like school?) or maybe it's because the previews for it aren't terribly interesting. Whatever the case, Nancy Drew has once again proved me wrong. My intuition on these games must be seriously off, because every game I'm sure I won't like ends up being one of my favorites. And this has indeed become one of my favorites of the early Nancy Drew titles. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy is hired as the Deputy Curator at a Washington, DC museum called Beech Hill. It is quite an exciting time for Beech Hill because they are preparing to open a new exhibit on the Maya, the highlight of which will be a very rare (and very expensive) artifact - a large elaborately carved stone called a monolith.\n\nBut poor Nancy just has the worst luck when it comes to vacations and dream jobs. Before she knows it, Beech Hill is robbed of one of its most beloved artifacts; a rare and unusual jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal. It seems to be related to a string of art thefts happening across the country, since in all the incidents Mayan jade artifacts were the target and a threatening red handprint was left at the scene.\n\nI thought this plot was just wonderful. It was well thought out, thorough, and unique among other ND titles. The length was perfect; I finished it over the course of a few days. There were lots of little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. It was interesting and intriguing, and very educational. Let me repeat that; it was VERY educational. It is set in a museum, after all. There is tons of information to take in - some of which is vital to the mystery of some of which is not. I have always loved history and am especially interested in the Maya and Aztec so this game was just my cup of tea. But if you don't like history - or aren't a big fan of plenty of reading in a ND game - this game might not be for you.\n\nCHARACTERS - 4/5: Suspects in this game include Joanna Riggs, the curator of Beech Hill and therefore Nancy's boss, a fairly serious young woman with a history of being a bit too eager to acquire artifacts for the museum. Henrik van der Hune is the museum's resident expert in translating Mayan glyphs, so he is arguably the only person in the museum who can guess an artifact's true value. Then there is Taylor Sinclair, an art dealer located in DC, who often does business with Joanna and appears to be unusually concerned over the museum's safety. Finally, there is Alejandro del Rio, a Mexican ambassador who accuses Beech Hill and other museums like it of flat-out stealing artifacts that rightfully belong to Mexico.\n\nPhone friends include Bess and George, the Hardy Boys, and Franklin Rose, who is a member of the Beech Hill board of directors and friend of Nancy's father. There are quite a few one or two time phone friends related to the plot as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the four suspects weren't very memorable. Their personalities were not particularly well defined and there wasn't anything quirky or fun about them. Worst of all, none of them were very suspicious. Basically, no one from this cast of characters is going to be making my favorites list anytime soon. However, the previous deputy curator, Sonny Joon, seen only in notebooks he left behind at the museum, was absolutely hilarious and his notebooks were a delightful comic relief. I hear he shows up again in some of the newer titles so I'm really looking forward to that.\n\nSETTING - 5/5: The setting was excellent. Beech Hill was very interesting and there was tons to look at inside. If it were a real museum I would definitely visit. Other places to see include Nancy's hotel room, Taylor's office, Alejandro's office, as well as some other locations that are unlocked throughout the course of the game. One thing that really blew me away was how realistic it all was. There were little things - like how could you see the exterior of every building before you entered it - that made a huge difference. It was so easy to get into the mystery because it really felt like I was there.\n\nPUZZLES - 4.5/5: I liked the puzzles, though this game tended to repeat itself as far as puzzles go. In other words, you do the same thing a few times throughout the game. The puzzles in the museum were mostly information scavenger hunts, where Nancy would be posed with a quiz question and you would have to search the museum exhibits for the answer. That didn't bother me, but I could easily understand someone finding it tedious and too slow-paced. In hindsight this game wasn't as puzzle-heavy as some other ND titles, which worked for me as I'm not a huge puzzle fan. But the puzzles did work in seamlessly with the plot and I never felt like I was stuck doing something unnecessary just to make the game longer.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING? Not really. Most - if not all - of the puzzles are explained by the game, and Nancy can call her friends for hints. I did go online for help once for a game of \"chance\" that I lost maybe 20 times in a row, thinking that there might be some strategy I was missing. But it seems that the mini-game couldn't be won until you reached a certain point in the plot, which frankly was pretty frustrating to learn I had wasted all that time. Anyways, I would give it a 3 for challenge.\n\nENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was probably the only part of this game that really didn't impress me. Although the ending was very intense, it was just sort of awkward and didn't make a whole lot of sense. The culprit wasn't too predictable and their motive made sense. Overall the ending was underwhelming. But be warned that the ending of this game is pretty creepy, and because of it I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for young children.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 4\nSetting: 5\nPuzzles: 4.5\nChallenge: 3\nEnding: 3.5\n= 25, divided by 6 = 4.16 rounded to 4 stars</td><td>07 7, 2013</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>null</td><td>History Buffs Rejoice!</td><td>1373155200</td><td>true</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is one of their learning heavy games, and I really appreciate that. It still manages to be extremely adventurous even though you're in the downtown of a big city rather than out in a castle, or a haunted mansion. The knowledge gained in this game is interesting, which is what makes the learning worth while. Just make sure you actually have a notebook sitting out to take notes.\n\nMy favorite part of this game is it's ending. It's hinted at a little bit, but when I first played through this game I never would have guessed at what would happen. As a kid, this ending scared me worse than the Ghost Dogs (of Moon Lake) ever could (I should mention that I got into these games just before this and Ghost Dogs was released, and Message in a Haunted Mansion didn't scare me because I -correctly- guessed at what was going on rather early, since I'd seen it so often before on Scooby Doo).\n\nI mark it as my fourth favorite (1. Treasure, 2. Blackmoor, 3. Shadow at Water's Edge, 4. this one, 5. Danger on Deception Island) and I understand why some people might get frustrated and want to put it down. But, unlike many of the games between 11 and 23, at least it doesn't leave people saying 'that's it?' at the end of it.</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>null</td><td>One of my top five favorite games.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>Sometimes when I find myself critiquing Nancy Drew games, I realize how much variety this series has, while still never really moving it's roots; The sleuthing that we all love has relatively stayed the same, but the setting changes with every game. Whether it's a haunted mansion, or a ranch or even a train, HERInteractive takes on a new form of fun with each additional mystery, and while Secret of the Scarlet Hand is an older game in the series, and definitely not one of my favorites, there is still fun to be had with it, and orginiality is clearly evident.\n\nStory: 6.5/10. Nancy lands an internship at a museum in Washington D.C, which is devoted to the Mayan culture and will soon be exhibiting a newly discovered monolith to the public. But, shortly before the exhibition, one of the museum's most treasured pieces is stolen from the museum, as well as a strange 'accident' that occurs involving the museum's epigrapher. It definitely wasn't one of my favorite plots, but was still somewhat interesting.\n\nSetting: 6.5/10. It was definitely an interestingly original idea to have a Nancy Drew game take place in a museum specializing in Mayan culture. You also get to hope on a subway to visit other character's offices, a hospital and Nancy's hotel room. I personally thought that the museum was pretty boring, but maybe less boring as the game progressed, and I found things I didn't know were there before.\n\nCharacters: 6/10. The characters were pretty annoying this time around. The epigrapher who got amnesia was very irritating to care to and talk to, Taylor Sinclair, an art specialist, was very annoying, and Alejandro, an ambassador to the Mexican Consolate, was even more annoying to talk to.\n\nPuzzles: 8.5/10. The puzzles were good this time around, and the only reason I'm saying this is that there's a pyramid inside the museum, and on each level on this part of the museum, there are different quizzes and games that you have to complete to progress to the next floor. This was a big part of the game and I LOVED it.\n\nActivities: 6/10. There weren't that many activities, but the games in the pyrmaid were decent.\n\nEnding: 6.5/10. The ending was obvious, and what you had to do to end the game was kind of confusing, and took me a few tries to get it right.\n\nTotal (averaged): 6.6 out of 10, averaged to....\n\n6.5/10.\n\nAlthough this game does have some originality and fun, it's too bland and boring for my taste, and I'd recommend new HERInteractive fans to go with another purchase for now.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>null</td><td>Secret of the Scarlet Hand review</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is here! The follow-up of \"The Final Scene\" continues to offer some great gaming with complex puzzles, intense plots, and some cool characters. While I prefer the previous three games, \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is a good game, and among the most important games in the series.\n\nNancy has decided to take a break and head out for an internship at Beech Hill Museum in Washington, D.C. Her dad's friend, Franklin Rose, has spoken with the Board of Directors to set this up for her, and she'll be working with several other experts of Mayan culture to set up Beech Hill's new exhibit, featuring a jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal and ancient monolith that was recently excavated from Mexico. While Nancy's internship starts off peaceful, Beech Hill soon becomes victim of a burglary! After the theft, Nancy finds a piece of paper with a gruesome scarlet hand left in the place of the now-missing Pacal carving. While investigating, she learns that a series of similar thefts have occurred around the country. Nancy's now determined to retrieve the carving and catch this thief red-handed.\n\nThe setting was great, and unlike any that's been seen in a Nancy Drew game before (or since). While there is more limited exploration, the areas that were able to be explored were nicely decorated and fully-interactive. I liked walking through the temple of Maya games and playing them all, as well as exploring other areas in Washington D.C. The abundant exploration that was in the previous three installments is definitely lacking here, though. There were several locations that didn't serve much of a purpose in the game (save to talk with a specific suspect) and the museum lacked any secret passageways. Regardless, the places that the suspects are conversed with are very nicely detailed and I rather enjoyed seeing different areas and buildings in Washington, D.C. while living vicariously through Nancy.\n\nSome of the chores were rather tedious, such as matching up an exhibit with its correct recording. However, chores like these were the exception instead of the rule. Most of the games were rather entertaining, especially the maze and ancient Mayan games.\n\nThe suspects are probably the most disappointing aspect in this game. They include the museum curator, Joanna Riggs, Henrik Van Der Hume, the artifact expert, Alejandro del Rio, the attach to the Mexican Consulate, and Taylor Sinclair, the art dealer who helped Joanna get her hands on several of the artifacts that will soon be put on display. As a whole, the suspects are rather flat and unable to be conversed with much. Joanna is especially guilty of this, as her character definitely borders on useless. Most questions Nancy asks her, she answers with something along the lines of \"Henrik can help you with that.\" Taylor and Alejandro are hardly much better when it comes to development, only serving to be conversed with once every so often and not providing much insight into the case. On the contrary, Henrik was awesome and nicely developed, and he winds up playing a very large role in the game itself.\n\nWhile three of the four suspects weren't very developed, they all did have some great motives to be the culprit in the end. Even though I didn't see this culprit coming when I first played the game, I see in hindsight that he/she is truly the most logical choice. This is definitely another game in which I cannot see anybody but the guilty party as the culprit in the end.\n\nAs stated before, the suspects weren't very nicely integrated. The phone friends, on the other hand, were very well scripted and employed. I loved all of the conversations that Nancy has on the phone with people, as they were humorously and cleverly composed. Most importantly, several characters that play important roles in the Nancy Drew series as a whole make their first appearance in this game, including Frank and Joe Hardy (AKA The Hardy Boys), Poppy Dada, Prudence Rutherford, and Sonny Joon. This is also the first game to feature the name of the Krolmeister company, which will play a substantial role in the games to come.\n\nThe music was definitely different when compared to other games, in that it has more of a \"historical\" and \"nature\" feel to it, while the soundtracks of other games were more \"mysterious\" and \"elegant\". This, however, is a bonus for this game. While previous games have focused on bandits, royalty, and magicians, this game focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization. The soundtrack was great for a museum filled with the histories of these ancient people, and all the tracks certainly felt in place.\n\nIs \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" my favorite Nancy Drew game of all time? No. Does it rank high on the list, though? Most definitely. While I did prefer the previous three games, this one certainly holds up to the high standards that the Nancy Drew series has set for itself. The plot is wonderful, and ultimately leads to an unforgettable and heart-pounding encounter that I never saw coming. Certainly can't wait to write about the next game all because of this one! :)</td><td>06 24, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>null</td><td>A Scarlet Secret Worth Discovering</td><td>1308873600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is one of my favorites in the series, but when playing this game I often found that they tried force too much history on you.  Other than that it's a great game, and I have the following comments on it:\n\nStory-You have a summer internship working at a Mayan museum in Washington D.C.  For those of you who don't know, the Mayan civilization was an Indian civilization that vanished without a trace.  Anyway, you are doing basic chores when a certain artifact is stolen, and a scarlet hand print is left at the scene of the crime.  Hence the title.  Eventually, you solve this mystery only to have another one thrown at you in the middle of the game, so you are actually getting 2 stories in 1.\n\nGraphics-These are pretty good graphics, with the backgrounds looking pretty real.  The characters still look definitely fake, but this has pretty good graphics still.\n\nSound-The music is okay with kind of a Mayan twist on it, but the voice acting really isn't that great.  And the lips are REALLY off.  I ignore it, and it doesn't bother me, but others it might bother a little bit.\n\nGameplay-The gameplay is exactly the same as the others in the series.  It is first person point-and-click.  You ride a metro system to get places, and the alarm clock is back, allowing you to go to sleep and wake up anytime you want.  The puzzles in this game are a little more difficult and numerous than in other games, and some of them are quite boring, but most are fun, and I can forgive the ones that aren't.\n\nFun-This game is pretty fun, but unlike the other games where there is just a tad bit of learning mixed in among the mystery, in this game, prepare to learn a LOT about Mayan history.  I hated it, because I hate history, but my friend loved it because he likes history.  I think the producers were just trying to appeal to history lovers as well as mystery lovers in this game, and I understand that.  No bad enough to give 3 stars, but not good enough for 5.\n\nLength-Oh.  My.  Goodness.  This is a rather long game.  It took me several months to finish, and whenever I replay it (which is a lot) it will take me about 12-15 hours because I still have trouble with some of the puzzles!\n\nThe puzzles are hard, but the answers are in the game, you just have to look for them.  The history is boring, but the story is great!  A great addition for history buffs, but if you don't like history, this game is still worth playing through at least once!</td><td>12 13, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>null</td><td>There is a large focus on Mayan history in this game</td><td>1260662400</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have played all the Nancy Drew titles from Her Interactive, and Secret of the Scarlet Hand (based on Nancy Drew book 125) is the best (and most impressive) of the lot. In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.\nFirst, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.\n\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.\nThis is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. \"Scarlet Hand\" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and \"Scarlet Hand\" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.</td><td>07 10, 2003</td><td>A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</td><td>Bundt Lust</td><td>null</td><td>&iexcl;Bienvenido al mundo de los maya!</td><td>1057795200</td><td>false</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is the 6th in this series by HER Interactive. Each game is full of clues, puzzles, and exciting (and possibly dangerous) adventures. \"Scarlet Hand\" is no exception. In this game, you (as Nancy) take an internship at the Beech Hill Museum, and when a priceless artifact goes missing, it's up to you to find out what's going on. You'll explore the museum (which includes a pyramid with several levels, and an outside exhibit), and take the subway to visit several other key locations. You'll talk to various people, all the while knowing that one of them could be the thief. It's a really fun game; I've played all the others and this one took longer than the previous game (\"Final Scene\") for me. It took about 10 hours on the senior level, and I was playing it with a partner. There are a lot of facts to write down and recall, and the puzzles in this game are very original. I was very pleased with the number of puzzles; just the right amount. What I really liked about this game, in comparison to some of the other Nancy Drew games, was that you didn't have to maneuver your mouse so much to find things. In some of the other games, you can only see objects if you position your cursor at just the right angle turning just the right direction. In this game, everything was very out in the open and the game was easy to maneuver; surprisingly, however, that didn't make the game any less challenging than its predecessors. Just another great addition to the \"Nancy Drew\" games collection, \"Scarlet Hand\" is sure to please gamers and mystery-lovers alike.</td><td>09 15, 2002</td><td>A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2</td><td>Molly P.</td><td>null</td><td>Another great game!</td><td>1032048000</td><td>false</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>B000069IL2</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>That's right, the free bill pay offer via MSN is worth more than the price of the software alone.

Secondly, Money 2003 didn't remove key functionality that its predecessors sometime did -- so if you use an older version of Money, the features you like are still there.  Thirdly, you can batch epayments together and send them all at once (conversely, Money 2002 sent a payment by piecemeal, which was extremely slow and frustrating).  Fourthly, a good product has been tweaked to iron-out some of the frustrations of earlier versions.  In all -- it's a nice piece of software.\nWhat I don't like:  So far, I like everything I've seen.  If there is something you don't like about Money, in all likelihood, there is an Options setting that will correct the problem.  For example, to remove \"sponsor\" ads from within Money, find the option setting to stop displaying all sponsor's ads (by default, they'll show up).  Also, when upgrading from an earlier version of Money, the newly-installed Money 2003 installation isn't smart enough to know that you already have a Money file that you want to just pick-up and use.

Does that make the cockroach a superior being? (Well, the immunity to radiation bit is in their favor.)\nJaguar is the latest release of OS X. A true multitasking operating system based on UNIX. Yes, there is a REAL version of UNIX under the hood and the hackers among you will drool over the possibilities. Apple is beginning to take advantage of the superior hardware design capabilities of the Mac with OS X.\nThe best part, OS X hides the UNIX underpinnings in a superior Graphical User Interface (known as Aqua.) So, if you know nothing about UNIX, don't worry, you don't have to know UNIX to use a Mac. Ease of use has been the hallmark of Macs since their introduction back in 1984.\nYou have the ability to create a true multi-user enviornment. Multiple userids, multiple processes running simultaneously and protected memory. This means if you have a program crash, only the one program will crash, everything else keeps going and going and going. (Sorry Energizer Bunny, I couldn't resist.)\nIf you are a UNIX lover, Apple provides the Terminal application which gives you full access to the UNIX kernel system.\nIf you are among the long-time Mac user community, you may have come to love the capabilities of OS 9 (or 8 or earlier.) Some Macs still have the ability to boot into either OS 9 or OS X. Newer Macs only allow OS X booting. If you still have programs from the days when you could boot into OS 9, you can still run many of them in \"Classic\" environment. Classic is an emulator, running on OS X to allow you to still run older programs requiring the older OS. Admittedly, there are programs that won't work in Classic. Mostly programs needing custom-made extensions or Control Panels may not load. Also, most of the still-existing software companies are creating native OS X versions of their programs.\nIf you insist on running Windows XP or 2000 or 98 or 95 or DOS, you even have the option of running Virtual PC (which, by the way, is now owned by Microsoft - think about that for a moment.)\nThere is also a Mac version of Microsoft's Office Suite. This allows you to exchange documents with your PC counterparts, seamlessly.\nMacs have superior video capabilities and OS X takes full advantage of this.\nOS X has some superior software to go along for the ride - iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto and iTunes, to name a few. These are all free.\nWith OS X, Mac users will be leaving others in the dust.\nSuperior hardware design coupled with well-thought-out software design makes the Mac environment hard to beat.

Why, you might ask, would Mac users pay to play with a not-yet-ready for primetime OS?  I suppose you should ask Windows users the same question.

NIS warns you when something is accessing the internet, an excellent feature especially if you are always connected with a broadband service.  It also alerts you if there is a potential attack on your computer and automatically blocks the attack.

Also, you can tell Norton about important information you may keep on your computer, such as credit card numbers and account information, that you want Norton to protect and not allow to be sent out.

WRQ's AtGuard was a model of simplicity.\nIt threw a popup box whenever it encountered an event it didn't\nhave a rule to match.  Let's say incoming traffic fell through\nall your rules: AtGuard asks \"What should I do?  Allow it\nall the time, just this once, block it once, or block it all\nthe time?\"  Four choice, covers the gamut.  In the cases of\nads, that's enough.  In the cases of TCPIP or ICMP traffic,\npermanent choices also brings you right into a quick dialog\nof exactly what to block (port, address) and how to name it\n(blocking 427 incoming, blocking ms-sql-m traffic).\nFor NIS, especially the NIS2k series, you don't have these\nadvanced choices.  You also have a great deal of \"preset\"\nrules that aren't always useful, because they err on the side\nof blocking rather than permitting.  Good for newbies, not\ngood for pros.\nAnother downside if you're experienced is that to get to rule\neditors and advanced options, you have to click through an\nenormous cascade of menus.  In AtGuard, it's two clicks away.\nThat's just unacceptable: if the purpose is to keep newbies\nout of the advanced menus, just add a password and unlock\nthe necessary menus.\nFinally, NIS2k does away with site-specific ad filtering.\nInexplicably, you have to choose to block images from an entire\ndomain instead of a single machine.  For anyone who surfs Yahoo,\nyou understand the value of allowing us.yimg.com and\nnot us.a1.yimg.com.\nIn terms of how NIS2k works with systems, I strongly\ndeter individuals from using it.

The Spam Alert function is not quite perfect at distinguishing between true spam and valid messages, but it is a feature of at least some utility, and I am happy to see Symantec trying to incorporate it into their already excellent software package.

Last and certainly not least, this software allows you to block a great number of those increasingly annoying pop-up ads proliferating online.\nIf this is your first time using the firewall software, you will have to go through some important steps in order to configure your security system for your own needs, but the system walks you through this pretty well, meaning you don't need to be a computer expert to do it.  You will also have to specify any personal information (such as credit card numbers) you want to protect from accidental release via web forms and the like, but this is not hard to do.

Peter Norton, where are you?\nNSW 2003 continues the tradition of bloatware (lots of files and components, many surreptitiously loaded into your system at runtime even if you don't want them), dangerware (my Windows 2000 laptop went kaput after running WinDoctor and I had to reformat the hard drive), and ripping off the loyal customer (no upgrades from previous versions, as Richard Clayton clearly noted).\nIf you run Windows 2000 and esp. XP, you already have all the tools to help you diagnose your system and keep it running (except anti-virus).  In fact those tools, while not as fancy-looking as NSW, does a much better job and are infinitely more stable.  Also, your PC vendor might have given you other free tools like an anti-virus program, which is probably just as good as NAV.  If you have Windows 98 or earlier, NSW will very likely crash your system rather than keeping it error-free.

Oh my this is going to be exciting!  I was looking forward to some beautiful nature scenery and I wasn't disappointed. Moon Lake and the general lay of the lands [cemetary, speakeasy, sprawling trees] captured my imagination immediately.  The story of Prohibition law-breaking and rum-running really caught my attentions and found myself absorbed in the newspaper clippings and the desire to find the gold bars. This plot line was one of the Top Ten stories HER had to offer us players thus far!\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 93\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nRed Knott: This weird bird watcher that observes avian only at night gave me the creeps as I thought I caught sexual innuendos when I talked with him in that treehouse. \" If I do this this for you, what are you going to do for me? [long pause] and \"Pretty girls should be okay out here\" [something along those lines].  I immediately went into \"stranger-danger\" mode and kept to the cabin when he was around. And he ALWAYS was!\n\nEmily Griffen: Her twangy voice was peculiar and I had her pegged as my # 1 suspect I think mostly because I felt force-fed information about the other two residents and didn't want to buy too much into these evidential setups.\n\nJeff Akers: The park ranger with the big aspirations and familial ties to the mob had all the makings of a culprit served on a platter. He had motives to get the land back into public hands, rumors of hidden gold, etc.  I loved reading all the information in the ranger station which could be opposed by many of the young gamers who \"don't want to be educated like they were in school\" ha, ha.\n\nVivian Burnett Whitmore: She has to be on my Top Ten list of ND characters based on how funny it was talking with her and the information she provided me [relationship with the gangster Mickey Malone, the four rottweilers] and the key she mailed over.\n\nBeth/George/Hardy Boys: Again, didn't care for the Hint System, but I know I always had a place to call for a good laugh [my girls!] Dialing the phone feature was VERY tedious!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 93\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nBased on how I used to enjoy the woods in my youth, the visuals was absolutely perfect; especially the moonlight sequences!  The speakeasy was lovely, but there really wasn't much to do except examine paintings and I was frankly disappointed. The thuggy jazzy score set up with stirring moody numbers brought my mind back to the roaring 20's.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 3 = 96\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  Now that I think about it, I don't think there were ANY mini-games. I know the puzzles revolved mostly on collecting items [bird pictures & critters] and staying focused on the makeup of the dogs colored collars and such.  Not  bad in any sense, but when you compare that to other ND games, those captured your attention more. In this game it was a slight let-down.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 95\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: I got to see the evidence into making the actual \"ghost dogs\" and loved the cuteness of these canines [although wanted to release them from their cage].  I guessed the culprit!!!! That makes my rating about 45%  All-in-all, I was pretty pleased.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 95\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me two days [8 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 82\n\nMy Strong Points: I pushed through at a pretty rapid pace and never really got into any entanglements from puzzles or stuck in plot line devices. The water valve puzzle was solved with my screwdriver ingenuity and the tunnel navigation was nearly flawless.\n\nMy Weak Points: I guess I missed it when Vivian said Waldo's other name, because this puzzle kept me grounded in thought needlessly. I died on the rotten floorboards, ha, ha\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 94 + 82/ 2 = 88.5 [ B + ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I agree with other gamers that the ghost dogs were underutilized. The fact why I don't consider it a problem was that this wasn't a horror movie, this was an adventure.  I was quite occupied with the engaging storyline and not worried that I was going to by chased through the forests with my life at stake. Although missing the A grade HER so often does, it is one of their top adventures in the series thus far.\n\nThus far, on my list of the 19 completed ND games, GHOST DOGS ranks.... # 1 !!!!!\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5\n2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 87.5\n3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 87\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.5\n5) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 84\n6) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 82\n7) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND  * 81\n8) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE  * 78\n9) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY  * 77.5\n10) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 77\n11) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 76.5\n12) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 72\n13) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 71.5\n14) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 71\n15) THE SILENT SPY  * 70.5\n16) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 70\n17) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 69.5\n18) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 69\n19) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 68</td><td>08 31, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Download, null, null, null)</td><td>A MOONLIT STROLL WITH MEMORIES OF MICKEY MALONE</td><td>1409443200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The very first time I played this game (waaay back when it was first released), I found myself incapable of finishing it because I was just too scared.

Also, you really get an interesting look into the past with this game.\n\nI would not suggest this for people who get bored easily or are impatient because this game does take a bit of digging, and, as the title of this review states, it's not the most riveting game out there. You are stuck out on Moon Lake, which has a very small population of three people and you at this point. But it does have a lot of places to unlock, which is something I like in my games (finding new areas as the game progresses, rather than everything being handed to you upfront). Not that games that don't have secret passages aren't as good, they can be great too. I just get a little tingly 'I'm an adventurer' feeling when I find places that no one has seen in decades (or centuries, in some games).

I still love to play the games from the classic part of the series (games one through nine), and although this one definitely isn't the best of the first few games, there are still a few positive aspects in this one, you just have to look hard to find some of them.\n\nStory: 8/10. This story is somewhat of a rarity for the Nancy Drew games, because it's pretty much two stories in one mystery: Ghoulish ghost dogs appear in the middle of the night and try to maul Sally McDonald's house (the house Nancy stays at in the game). There is also the theory that a man named Mickey Malone buried treasure somewhere on Sally's property, which used to be his land. I loved the idea of two stories, and these two melded together pretty well, and were pretty well done.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 7/10. Since this game was released in late 2002, the graphics aren't going to be that amazing, but the setting was somewhat decent, as you got to explore a convenience store, a forest, a graveyard, a sheriff station and the actual house Nancy stays at.\n\nCharacters: 6.5/10. This game has one or two less suspects than usual Nancy Drew games (this one has 3 people that you meet in person), and they somewhat feel bland. You have Emily, the southern store owner, Red, the anthropic bird watcher, and Ranger Akers, the strict runner of the town who loves ticketing people. None of them are very colorful, and definitely aren't the highlight of this game.\n\nPuzzles/Exploring: 5.5/10. They're aren't many puzzles in here as there are tasks, and one thing that forces me to knock down this game's score is that exploration feels practically nonexistent. They're really isn't anything to search or sleuth in besides a frustratingly big forest and the occaisonal passage. But the few puzzles that were there I could usually do without hints, which means that they were really simple.\n\nActivities:5/10. Another thing that is pretty much nonexistent in this game. The only things that even come close to fun activities in this game are bird-watching and reading the lake's history on the Sheriff's computer. I would have like more plain fun to be added in this game.\n\nEnding:\n7.5/10. Some endings take a little bit of time to complete, and may even require a second chance, but this one is over very quickly, yet it somehow gives you that goosebumpy feeling that good Nancy Drew endings give you. I'm sure you know what I mean\n\nTotal (average): 6.58 out of 10, averaged to....\n\n6.5/10.\n\nWhile there can still be some fun to be had with this game if you're a diehard fan like me, I'd recommend that new Nancy Drew PC fans or someone looking for one of the games to buy, look at another HERInteractive title for now.</td><td>08 22, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake review.</td><td>1313971200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The Nancy Drew games are nothing short of phenomenal. Nearly every game before this one has held onto a classical quality of mystery, intrigue, and adventure. This wonderful 7th addition, \"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\", is no exception at all.\n\nThis game takes place shortly after the previous game. While interning at Beech Hill, Nancy's friend Sally sent Nancy a letter asking for her help. Something frightening has been happening ever since she's moved into her new home in Moon Lake, Pennsylvania, and she's hoping that Nancy can find out what. Nancy naturally agrees to drive out, only to find out that Sally's been frightened away from her home. What exactly did this? The answer comes all too quickly when pack of four ghost hounds that attack the house while Nancy's inside. Legend has it that they once belonged to Mickey Malone, the gangster who originally lived in the house, until their beloved owner passed away. Upon his death, the dogs ran off into the neighboring woods, and could be heard howling in the distance until they all died. They now return every time somebody tries to live in the old Malone home. Could these dogs be seeking their owner in the netherworld, or is a sinister criminal trying to scare Sally away from her property? And if it's the latter case, why?\n\nThe plot used in this game is truly a masterpiece. I've yet to find another story like this one. This case is definitely another stepping stone in the realm of Nancy Drew gaming, offering a plot unlike any other, and giving a fresh, new feel to the series while doing so.  The house is very detailed, and I loved exploring the nearby woods. The graphics are very beautifully realistic, and made me feel as if I was right there with Nancy as she listened to the beautiful birds sing by day or wandered through the creepy woods at night.\n\nThis game only has three suspects, which is a move never used before (all games before have had four, except for Stay Tuned for Danger with six). Some might not like this move, but I thought it was a pretty good one, because it left space for originality in the game. It also made it more realistic - really, if we were solving cases in real life, what would be the odds that we'd ALWAYS have four suspects every time?\n\nThe suspects include a retired antisocial bird watcher named Red Knott, who spends most of his time on his observation platform making odd noises to get birds out of hiding. Emily Griffin is another suspect in the game, and is the owner of a store called Em's Emporium, specializing in antiques from the 20's. The last suspect is Ranger Jeff Akers, the park ranger for Moon Lake who enjoys bossing people around. All of the characters had very solid motives to want Sally out of her house, but the most solid motives don't come to light until nearly halfway into the game. I wasn't really sure who'd be the culprit in the end, but was rather happy with the culprit choice that was made.\n\nThe other six games before this one all had excellent soundtracks. \"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\" is no exception. This game features a lot of music with a strong \"nature\" feel to it, and it was very peaceful to listen to while exploring the woods and around Moon Lake's community. At night, the music becomes slower and more eerie, and it was complimented by the sound of chirping crickets. The music played whenever Nancy's in danger was as suspenseful as always, but also had a bit of that \"dark nature\" edge to it like the nighttime music did. \"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\" is yet another example of a game with a perfect soundtrack.\n\n\"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\" is another term for \"a great step in the Nancy Drew series\". I can't complain about this game much at all, and everything within it is so rich and fresh. I love this game, and I can't wait to write about the next one! :)</td><td>06 25, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>More Fun than a Barrel of Ghost Dogs</td><td>1308960000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Now, normally I wouldn't have gotten this game. All the reviews say it's terrifying, and I'm really not into that. But, since I got it as a Christmas present, I gave it a try. And I will be the first to tell you that it's NOT terrifying, and it's actually pretty good! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy goes to visit her friend Sally MacDonald at Moon Lake because Sally says some terrible things have been happening at her lakeside cabin. When Nancy gets there, though, Sally has left out of fear. So Nancy decides to stay and solve the mystery of the ghost dogs who show up at night and attack the cabin. I thought this was a really good plot. Unlike in some other ND titles, I really wanted to solve the mystery and find out where these dogs were coming from. And trust me, the dogs weren't the least bit scary. The plot wasn't too short or too long. Another solid plot from Her Interactive!\n\nCHARACTERS - 4/5: There was a real lack of characters in this game. There were only 3 that you could actually see. I guess they did that so Moon Lake would really feel desolate, and it worked. The three main characters were Red Knott, an anti-social bird watcher, Emily Griffen, the store owner who has a fun accent, and Jeff Akers, the lone park ranger. Overall, the characters were OK. I kind of wish there was more, though.\n\nSETTING - 4/5: The setting was pretty good. I can't say it was beautiful or anything, because although it was well done, it was just kind of creepy looking. But there was lots to explore, including a whole forest maze that was really hard to get the hang of. There wasn't much to see inside the cabin, or around the lake, but the forest was pretty big so that made up for it.\n\nPUZZLES - 4/5: The puzzles were pretty easy in this game. I could figure most of them out without a walkthrough. The maze was probably one of the hardest puzzles, and I kept getting lost. But other than that they were all short and sweet.\n\nWAS IT CHALLENGEING?: Nope.

I liked how they revealed who the culprit was, and catching them was very clever.

She won't tell you over the phone what's scaring her, though, and when you get to her house, she's gone!  You soon find out that dogs with glowing eyes have been attacking her house, and they have scared her away.  You can call her in the game, so don't think she's been kidnapped or something.\n\nGraphics-They were pretty good, and the dogs didn't look that bad.  The characters still need some work, and the backgrounds could be better, but overall, I love the graphics.\n\nSound-The music has a slight country twist on it, and although I hate country music the music isn't that bad in the game.  The voice acting could have been better, but it's not as bad as it's been before.\n\nGameplay-The car you drove up in is blocked by a tree that fell down right behind it, so you have to get around via motorboat, which you have to fix first.  Also, there are only 3 characters in the game, so it really gives you the feeling that this is definitely not the city anymore.  Point-and-click is the same.  So is calling Bess and George for hints.  There is a tad bit of history in this game but not as much as in the last game.  Thank goodness!  You have to choose day or night, however, and you don't have an alarm clock in this game.\n\nFun-Yeah, this is a fun game, but as before mentioned in other reviews, the puzzles don't have much to do with the story, and they revolve a lot around Roman numerals.  The puzzles aren't great, but the story really makes up for it.  Still, the story is not the least bit scary, but it is still a great story.\n\nLength-Not as long as the last one, playing this one through is about 10 hours, but of course, the first time you play it, it will be longer.  It does have a replay value, but the puzzles are rather dull that I just don't bother with this game that much.\n\nA great game with an excellent story but rather dull puzzles.

It's really scary in the beginning and in other sections too. You have to snoop around at night and go to the graveyard! I'd say it is pretty freaky. But it's loads of fun. I only got stuck really bad ONCE during the entire game. That doesn't mean it's super easy but it just means that it's not extremely hard to the point where you can't figure it out yourself.

This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the \"ghost dogs.\" Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house.\nNancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or flesh-and-blood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Em's Emporium (Moon Lake's general store), Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the \"hauntings,\" and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail (where he died). Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger.\nAs in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if she's not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often!\n\"GDoML\" features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore: Mallone's cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map (the one included in the game didn't help me much). That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancy's progress onscreen.\nOne nifty feature was Nancy's PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types: numeric/dials/switches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an \"alarm clock\" setting to change from day to night since some tasks (and events) can only be completed then.\nGraphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done (the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs). The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple: all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360 rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters: in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lip-synching was really bad. In \"GDoML,\" at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun: in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearing-impaired players (a very nice touch), including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game \"The Haunted Carousel.\" Overall this is a nice introduction to the Nancy Drew series from Her Interactive and a fun mystery to solve with plenty of details and creepy moments.

In fact, I feel that it could have been better in so many ways.  Don't get me wrong.  The Nancy Drew games series is great.  In each game, you, as Nancy Drew, gather clues, interview people, solve puzzles, explore secret passages, and find the culprits.  The games are engaging, fun, and even educational.  And they're fun for both kids and adults alike.  The first game in the series, \"Secrets Can Kill,\" was well-intentioned but the character graphics (and the fact that you had to switch back and forth between two CDs) left much to be desired.  However, after \"Secrets,\" the games began to significantly improve.  You would think, then, that by the seventh game, the games would be stellar.  Not true.  I think they peaked at game three (\"Message in a Haunted Mansion\") and four (\"Treasure in a Royal Tower\").  It's almost as if, by game seven, the designers/creators have run out of ideas.  I don't mean for the plots -- I mean for puzzles, for character's wisecracks, that sort of thing.  Things that move the game along and make it fun.  Most every puzzle in \"Ghost Dogs\" was eerily similar to a puzzle we've seen in a previous Nancy Drew game, the only exception being the one you have to play when Nancy is in peril toward the middle of the game (this is not a spoiler; in just about every Nancy Drew game, Nancy is in peril about halfway through the game.)  That puzzle was fun.  But the others could have been better.  Also, in each Nancy Drew game there is some sort of educational element.  You learn things as you go along, from books, computers, newspaper articles, or signs.  But in this game, there was a HUGE amount of information on parks on one single computer.  Most of this information wasn't even important to the game.  Why is it there?  Who's going to sit there and read it?  With all due respect, I was just slightly bored with \"Ghost Dogs.\"  My last complaint (and I really don't mean to sound like a picky grouch; I love Nancy Drew, really, I do) is Nancy's personal data assistant that she carries with her now.  She puts all her clues in there.  She even carries maps around with her now!  One of the most fun things about the Nancy Drew games, for me, has been that you have to write down clues (on paper, in real life), trace maps, etc.  If I happen to not notice a clue in \"Ghost Dogs,\" well hey, Nancy (but I thought *I* was Nancy?) has already jotted it down for me.  And this was on the senior level!  I guess I could just NOT look at the PDA, but come on, it's too tempting.  Where's the challenge?  I really hope the next game will be better; from the promo, it looks very intriguing.  And I *do* have faith in the designers to make this next one a winner.  In conclusion, me just say this: if you've never played a Nancy Drew game before, you'd be safe to start with this one, since all the puzzle concepts would be new to you.  But it's not the best.  Still, if you're a Nancy Drew fan, it's still pretty amusing and so I give it 4 stars.</td><td>01 28, 2003</td><td>A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2</td><td>Molly P.</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Not the best Nancy Drew game there is</td><td>1043712000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The seventh in the series, these games are relatively inexpensive yet provide hours of gameplay. In them, Nancy Drew, the college-aged female detective, explores mysteries and finds solutions to various puzzles.\nYou can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the 'snapshot' quality is more of a flow. It's still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go \"to\" a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a \"hot spot\" in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you can't click on something, it's not important.\nThere's no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games I've lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs don't actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning.\nThe game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons aren't in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if you're cleaning areas where mice live.\nThere are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like you're really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world.\nOn the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it.\nStill, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. It's not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have 'beaten it'. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, it's a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those \"little grey cells\" in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects.

It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.\nI'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation.

This is what computers have promised to deliver for some time now.  In this and other ways, Microsoft is finally bringing it to users in a usable, intuitive manner.\nPrevious features such as spellchecking, grammar, integration and smart cut-copy-paste operations are all present.  Perhaps the best addition to the suite is Microsoft's OneNote, which promises to capture freeform notes and text in whatever way you like, digitizing tablet handwriting or keyboard entry; the killer app is how it recognizes the handwriting and indexes the text for finding your notes again.  Call it system-wide Graffiti for Windows.\nStill, this is Office and the usual bloat in disk space, system requirements, and price tag all apply.  This is a release most-targeted for businesses that can afford to roll this out to many users under a favorable license.  If a company such as GE had to pay $450 a seat, you can bet GE would be using a competitor's product tomorrow.  So for an individual, Office is still a four-star player.\nFor anyone considering Office 2003, let me weigh in with a wet blanket on previous rave reviews: if you have Office 2000/2002/XP, you don't need this release.  Honestly.  This iteration does not contain a truly compelling feature set that will bring you to spend a few hundred dollars.  Microsoft's OneNote is good, maybe even killer, but you've gotten along without it for quite some time now, haven't you?\nTo put all this in a single paragraph: if you're on Office 97 or earlier, and can score the upgrade, and have the bucks, this is a good release to use.  However, if you don't have the bucks, Office 2002 or even Office 2000 are still viable alternatives that provide 95% of the features at 30-70% of the cost.</td><td>11 26, 2003</td><td>A2ZR3YTMEEIIZ4</td><td>Christopher Wanko</td><td>null</td><td>Five starts is debatable, its utility is not.</td><td>1069804800</td><td>false</td><td>263</td></tr><tr><td>B0000AZJVC</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.

The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.\nHowever, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.\nAnd Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.

Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.\nWord 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.\nExcel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.\nOutlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with \"Clear Type\" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.\nPowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.\nThis new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.\nPublisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher.

Outlook 2003 is easier to use than any previous version.\nMicrosoft Office 2003 is a complete solution for the home and business user alike. It is an essential tool for students and developers.

This version (2003) -- although superior to later versions -- did pick up a little bloat since 2000, and Help has largely become an online feature (not sure how much/to what extent), and that is mildly unfortunate.  Sad that MS _seems_ to be determined to somewhat ruin their flagship products in numerous ways (??) -- but very grateful their outstanding, earlier products can still be acquired and used, for a while anyway.\n\nSo, although not quite as hot as Office 2000, this 2003 version is more current concerning file formats, and new features that are needed on occasion.

So in these instances, you're going to want a version that is capable of dealing with the newer XML, HTML, what have you.

It may be a god-send one day but today it is still not a major factor and certainly does not demand a major update.  The RESEARCH option is something to contend with and could be quite useful - it is almost like having Encarta loaded on your machine as well.  I found it a bit limiting though; it is good as a thesaurus but there is no world atlas, quotation source, etc.  Many people have applauded the new look and feel of Outlook.  Again, it behaves just the same as previous versions of Outlook did.\n\nMicrosoft chose to retire the Office bar and that is a big mistake.  They are trying to push the Quick Launch bar but most businesses and almost all Office users preferred the Office bar.\n\nDon't get me wrong:  Office 2003 works very well and with Word, Outlook, Excel, Access and Publisher you can literally do anything!  It also preforms very well.  But, again, unless Microsoft starts making major changes, these releases should not be heralded as new.  If anything, they should be upgrades that former users should be able to download if they registered the original product - the cost is too prohibitive to justify upgrading.  And, as your Office 97 or XP works just as well, you should think seriously before spending the money.</td><td>01 31, 2005</td><td>A1QQDHM5YMLQ8Z</td><td>Joe Albanese</td><td>null</td><td>The latest version</td><td>1107129600</td><td>false</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>B0000AZJVC</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is the newest version of Microsoft Office.

There's much to like in this program; however, I've installed the upgrade on two different machines (the Small Business version on a Dell Dimension 8200 desktop, and the Professional version on an IBM T40 Thinkpad); upon intallation IE6 immediately began generating run-time errors.  I've been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found I'm not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  It's extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: \"it's probably due to spyware\".  Well, I've been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didn't exist until I installed this upgrade).  I can only conclude that any spyware causing these problems must be embeded in the upgrade!\nSo, beware of the potential for IE6 run-time errors if you install Office 2003.  Also, if you use Act! (or a similar program) that runs on top of Outlook, you'll find that a supposed new security feature in Outlook requires you to manually permit Act to retrieve e-mail from Outlook every time new mail arrrives.  It's a real pain!!!\nTo summarize, there's not enough in this upgrade to justify putting up with these problems (or features, in Microsoft parlance), and I wouldn't have upgraded had I known what I was in for.</td><td>11 4, 2003</td><td>A1GOKUUDRB63FQ</td><td>Stratman351</td><td>null</td><td>A mixed bag...nice features, but seems to bug laden</td><td>1067904000</td><td>false</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>B0000BX73E</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.

The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.\nHowever, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.\nAnd Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.

Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.\nWord 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.\nExcel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.\nOutlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with \"Clear Type\" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.\nPowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.\nThis new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.\nPublisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great.

Macros work okay, but are best written up in the macro editor. Text for use outside of Word is best saved as a plain Text file, and any formatting done within the destination application. Framemaker, for example.\n\nWord is a good word processor and is not a DTP application to any useful extent. And used in its word processor mode, it does compare more than favourably with any alternative that I have tried. And that's quite a few.

It's also a good idea to visit and subscribe to word tips, who have a huge amount of advice about Word in general and macros in particular.\n\nAll in all, there's not too much to complain about if the aforementioned is observed.

This would have been the fourth upgrade since I already own Norton Internet Security and System Works for 2001, 2002, and 2003. This new activation scheme is outrageous!!! I did not use any pirated software and I don't intend to start now but I change my hardware a lot and reinstall applications and I find that by requiring product activation Symantec hits me as a legitimate user since the product allows only 5 activations. In 4 months I will be unable to use it if I reinstall the OS 5 times, and here I am, a legitimate user and a loyal customer who paid Symantec for 4 years unable to use software I paid for.

There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the \"download warranty\" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didn't want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.  But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all.\nThe run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down?\nNext issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called \"Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse\".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?

IT IS A SLOW PACKAGE and can not be used in the background without a very fast machine or else you will be on a serious go-slow. For that reason do virus scanning when you are not doing anything on your PC. The Live updater is great and brings your system up to date with the latest viruses and AD-AWARE!

To be honest this is a must for any system.\nThe only drawback I found was in the Norton File Protection system. This KEEPS files after you have deleted them from your recycle bin. You need to actually turn it off from the Norton Antivirus control panel and then go into the bin and delete items manually. This took me a few hours how to figure out properly but the documentation is online if you look for it.\nAlthough the package is slow - it is extremely solid, robust and finds those files that you need to remove. It may be a bulky added extra to your system but it will save your files some day and in this day and age you must have some protection (Try the FREE software packages out there like AVG and Ad-Aware to see what could be on your system!).\nLike I said I have never had any install/uninstall problems.

This may be coincidence, but without fail every single one of those individuals (about 5 or 6 computers in all) ended up being knocked out of commission by viruses. On the computers that have had Norton on them, since 1999, I have not had one instance of a virus.\nI know that this experience isn't everybody's, and I know that no program can stop all viruses all the time, but so far Norton has a perfect record for me, so I will keep using it. Now that they have developed the Bloodhound feature to protect against new and unknown viruses, I'm assuming that it will be even better.\nMy one warning is that right out of the box, Live Update is not activated. I don't know why this is as many of my family who have installed it themselves do not manually activate it (since they didn't know they had to) and therefore operate with really old virus definitions until I go into the settings and turn LiveUpdate on.\nI have not hesitate to recommended Norton for every computer that my extended family has purchased.

I have stuck with the program because it works and works well, and with each new release it works even better.  For those who use Norton Antivirus 2003, there is little difference in the program, and perhaps the primary reason to move the newer version is the renewed subscription you will receive; the interface is the same.  Rather than radically changing the program from year to year, Symantec has made little improvements which enhance overall performance.  The results have been the consistency of a program that does the job of stopping viruses and does it well.\nInstallation:\nInstallation of Norton Antivirus 2004 is as straight forward as it is easy.  Barring any gaffes, the program will install and then ask you to register with Symantec which I recommend since this will setup the virus signature subscription program which lasts a year.\nTechnical Note: A virus signature is a file which contains information the antivirus program needs to defeat viruses and clean infected files.  Without updated signature files the anti-virus program would soon become outdated.  Symantec, through Live Update, continually downloads new signature files to Norton Antivirus 2004 via a subscription service which is part of the program.  However, the service lasts only a year and must be renewed-for a fee of course.\nUsers-like me-who also use Norton Internet Security 2003 (which shipped with Norton Antivirus 2003), will find that the program also interoperates with Norton Antivirus 2004.  During the installation process the older version will be removed and Norton Antivirus 2004 will be integrated with Internet Security 2003.\nAs is the trend in software these days, Norton Antivirus 2004 will have to be \"activated\" either by the Internet or phone within 15 days of installation or it will stop working.\nUpon completion of the installation process Live Update will run and update the program with the latest program files and virus signatures.  Live Update will continue to run in the background (whenever you are on the Internet) in order to keep Norton Antivirus 2004 up to date.\n\nFirst Impressions:\nI am still impressed by this program.  As I stated above I have used Norton Antivirus for a number of years and I have grown to respect its functionality.  Symantec has fixed the once vexing problem that plagued earlier releases of Norton Antivirus, resource allocation, as the program had a tendency to consume more than its share.  This is no small issue since the program runs in the background.  However with the release of Norton Antivirus 2003, Symantec licked the resource issue, resulting in a much better functioning program.\nThe sole purpose of an antivirus program is to protect your computer from viruses and this is where Norton Antivirus 2004 outshines the rest. Norton Antivirus 2004 protects your computer in the background in three primary ways:\n* Auto-Protect: protects your computer in the background by continuously monitoring system files for malicious code, including the boot sector, and memory.  Also checks files as they are downloaded from the Internet or from a floppy or other removable disk.  This option can be turn off.\n\n* Inbound & Outbound Email Scanning: as the title implies, Norton Antivirus 2004 integrates with your email program and automatically scans incoming and outgoing email, or can be set up to scan either.  In the case of outgoing mail a small box will pop up from the task bar indicating scan progress.  And incoming virus via an email will result in a popup box asking you what you want done with the offending code.  This option can be turn off.\n* Script Blocking: monitors script-based viruses like those encoded in emails of applets executed from the Internet, and alerts you to such behavior, stopping these viruses before they can infect your computer.  This option can be turn off.\nI utilize all three options because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and I continually receive email, both personal and professional.  Just today Norton Antivirus 2004 detected three viruses in spam sent to one of my email addresses.  To me, the program pays for itself the very first time it saves your computer from a malicious attack.\nVirus Scanning:\nNorton Antivirus 2004 can accomplish virus scanning manually or via scheduled events which you can control.  Manual scans can be accomplished at any time and the option exists to scan the following:\n* My Computer\n* Scan all removable drives\n* Scan all floppy disks\n* Scan drives\n* Scan folder\n* Scan files\nCustom scan jobs can also setup and run immediately, or scheduled to run at a later time.  I have setup the program to scan my network drives every Saturday night at 2:00 A.M. and my computer at the same time on Sunday, thereby freeing me from worrying about doing a complete scan on a regular basis.  Norton Antivirus 2004 does it for me!\nConclusion:\nVirus protection has gone from a nice-to-have utility to a necessity that every computer connected to the Internet, or a network (work or home), or used jointly, cannot do without.  For me Norton Antivirus 2004 is the best anti-virus program on the market, and I highly recommend it.</td><td>11 17, 2003</td><td>A3QMJMTLJC34QC</td><td>Vincent E.

This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend.\nBesides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.\n Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.\nAs usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you're really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive!

Well, you know that never works out especially when Katie is involved with controversy concerning a lone Orca that made its way onto the coast.  The whale isn't leaving and Kati's boat is sabotaged. Many reasons crop up? Was it because she won't sell out to a local tour company? Is it because she is intimately involved in whale correspondence?  Hmmmm.....[as ND would say].\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 87\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nKatie Firestone: She is involved in repairing her engine the WHOLE adventure! I really don't have confidence she knew what she was doing in regards to mechanical repair.  But, I guess she had nobody she trusted and it seemed it all happened in 24 hours [which is weird]. I didn't expect her to be the culprit at any point.\n\nHolt Scotto: For someone running for a political position such as Harbormaster, he can get pretty mouthy.  It's probably the sailor in him [ya know, you can never take the sailor out of the man....:) ].  I loved his personal quiz. Using the internet wasn't such a problem, but I was a little surprised on how much the game made me rely on it.  I'd have liked it if HER could have included a couple more local characters that provided that information through their life experiences. I know that HER doesn't flesh out it's character list with bodies that don't interact with Nancy directly, but it was also strange to hear the hustle and bustle of the Hot Kettle Cafe patronage when the place was vacant the entire adventure!\n\nAndy Jason: This guy gave me the chills.  He seemed a tool; was that it? Was it the \" Whale Rules!\" anthem he irritated me by? I don't know, but I had him as my # 1 culprit because the other characters just didn't fit the profile.\n\nJenna Deblin: She really thought a lot about herself, but she knew how to cook! I had a chance to eat her muffins, but was never given another chance at them after the initial offering! I thought that was quite odd.\n\nHilda Swenson: This was a major character that ND never had the benefit of seeing. I don't remember another situation like that throughout the games I have played that avoided direct contact. I guess I was okay  with that.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nThe moodiness of the Pacific Northwest coastline was captured perfectly with fog and drabness.  The sounds of the sea [water splashing] and beach was above par.  The music had you captured in the moment when you were on a small mission and knew when to be subtle when you entered a building.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 88\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The chess game I got from Holt's book was awesome and right up my alley because I am pretty proficient.  I already knew about poker scoring and the plaque punch to earn a royal flush was just okay. The coordinates challenge really bothered a lot of reviewers, but I was fine with that whole system. In general, there was nothing that captured my fancy.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87\n\nADVENTURE ENDING:  The new scenario aboard the ship was quite interesting although I wished I could have explored more aboard the deck.  I was happy to interact with the orca whale, but I always have the nervousness in the back of my mind what they can do to humans if they are angered.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 87\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me three days [10 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 75\n\nMy Strong Points: I guessed the culprit immediately and I didn't waver off my initial thoughts.  I really didn't need a walkthrough for most of the adventure and I navigated well through the bay's waters via kayak.\n\nMy Weak Points: A couple puzzles were greatly confusing [sea cave snake puzzle & the wood identification]. I thought I was doing a good job with the descriptions and apparently I wasn't!\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I felt my enjoyment level was suppressed the entire game. Was it the gloomy atmosphere, was it the uninviting characters? I know that I wanted to solve the mystery, but there was no hold over me where i felt enthusiastic.

Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending).

Also, after looking at several other games, I've come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isn't the most exciting game, so if you're looking for a game to get into the series with I'd point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch.

While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.\n\nBeing a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:\n\nStory: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.\n\nCharacters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.\n\nPuzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.\n\nActivities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.\n\nEnding: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.\n\nTotal (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....\n\n8/10.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you don't already have it, it's probably my second favorite one in the series (behind \"Secrets of the Old Clock.\").</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>One of my favorite Nancy Drew games ever!</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0000CEM5O</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The last 6 Nancy Drew games have all been exceptional. They're so easy to get immersed in, with hours of fun and detective work being spent playing them. \"Danger on Deception Island\" continues this great series on a wonderful route, and continues to be one of the best Nancy Drew games released to this date.\n\nNancy's friends Bess and George have arranged a vacation for her. Nancy will be staying with Katie Firestone, a marine biologist friend of George's, in Snake Horse Harbor, Deception Island (one of the San Juan Islands off the cost of Washington state). Nancy is immediately greeted by Katie, who was just getting back to her houseboat from getting groceries. When the two make it back to the boat, they discover that it's been ransacked and vandalized. Could this be the latest work done by an unknown group that's been robbing shops around town? Not only that, but an orphaned killer whale has recently made home in the harbor surrounding the town, and seems to be hanging around all by itself for no apparent reason.  Just who did this to Katie? Who are these vandals and robbers? And what's the real deal with this orca? It's now up to Nancy to submerge herself into the dangers surrounding Snake Horse Harbor to find the truth...\n\n\"Danger on Deception Island\" employs amazing graphics. Even though this game is a bit older, several of the graphics in this game could rival those used in games today. The suspects look so realistic that they almost look like actual actors and actresses. The graphics seen while kayaking, exploring the town, and walking on the beaches are nothing short of beautiful. Some real (or at least, realistic) photos of sea life are also presented throughout game play, which is a definite bonus. I felt like I was actually walking through a town by the beach while playing this game, instead of just playing a game featuring one.\n\n\"Danger on Deception Island\" has some of the best mini games, puzzles, and challenges that had been seen in Nancy Drew games upon its release. I especially enjoyed the mini games in Whale World (one of the explorable areas in the game). However, are several ways to die multiple times in this game (which doesn't bother me, but does some others), and one of the puzzles that involves getting a set of coordinates is very challenging and time-consuming. Aside from that puzzle, I can't complain at all.\n\nAll of the characters had their quirks, but they were a pretty well-casted bunch. Every suspect fit the story rather nicely, and they all had moments when they looked like they could be the culprit. The culprit becomes rather shocking, as there are several clues that come up and point toward another character(s) at the end of the game, until the ultimate truth is revealed. I could hardly wrap my mind around the fact that this character was the guilty party, but it was definitely a very tasteful twist (though I still would've slightly preferred the culprit being somebody else).\n\nThe first suspect met is Katie Firestone, who's a friend of George's and a marine biologist. She's pretty strong-willed, and definitely has some secrets that she's hiding from Nancy. Holt Scotto is an elderly fisherman who's running for harbor master, and doesn't particularly like Katie's defense of a policy that forces boats to stay several feet away from the whale (as he has to take the long way to get out to sea). Jenna Deblin is the owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and thinks Katie has a lot of secrets as to what she truly wants to do with the whale (i.e. study it instead of help it). Andy Jason is the owner of Whale World, a tourist attraction that specializes in educating visitors in facts about whales, and wants Katie to sell out to him.\n\nWhat really made the characters awesome was dialogue shared between Nancy and her phone friends. The conversations had with Bess and George and Frank and Joe Hardy were all very nicely scripted. Not a single one ever felt boring. The one-time phone friends were pretty memorable in their own ways too, such as Casey Porterfield (who constantly has a hard time understanding Nancy) and Hilda Swenson (she's so... well, I'll let you find out for yourself). The phone friends in this game were much better than the phone friends in several games were, and I would definitely like to see some of the one-timers make a second appearance.\n\nThe musical score in this game was awesome, which could be said about every single game created before it. However, this game does have a bit more going for it musically, as it definitely goes out of its way to make itself unique. The game features a lot of songs that sounded like they belonged in a movie about sailors, or from a kid's special to educate children about the seas and those who travel them. I felt like it went out of its way to make itself more \"beachy\" than other soundtracks have to make themselves \"scarier\" or more \"royal\". The realistic sounds of waves, seagulls, and seals made the music all the more fitting.\n\nSo, is Danger on Deception Island the best Nancy Drew game ever? I'd say it ranks among them. There are very few complains that I can make about this game, as nearly everything about it goes above and beyond. I would love to see Nancy re-visit Deception Island in a future case, as well as meet several of the characters she met here again. The game is *THAT* good!</td><td>06 27, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Fun on an Island of Dangerous Deception!</td><td>1309132800</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0000CEM5O</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I had VERY high expectations for this game, and I'm happy to say that it met all of them! It's definitely one of my new favorites! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited to Snake Horse Harbor to go whale watching with Katie Firestone. But when Nancy gets there, she discovers Katie's boat has been vandalized. Somebody in Snake Horse Harbor is up to something illegal, and it's up to Nancy to figure who it is! I thought that the plot was excellent. It was really intriguing and had lots of twists and turns and really kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot was so unique and fun, it's a perfect example of just how awesome Nancy Drew games can be!\n\nCHARACTERS - 5/5: There was a good amount of characters in this game, and they all had incriminating evidence against them, so it was practically impossible to guess who the culprit was! There was Katie Firestone, a marine biologist who's nice, but virtually everyone in town hates her. Then there's Holt Scotto, and old school fisherman who's running for political office as Harbormaster. Jenna Dublin, who runs the local cafe and especially hates Katie. Then there's Andy Jason, who owns a whale museum and rivals Katie's whale watching tours. I think Andy was my favorite person to talk to because it was hilarious every time he said \"And remember...WHALES RULE!\" And, of course, there was the orca herself, who was very cute!\n\nSETTING - 5/5: The setting was really well done. I've been to Washington State, and this game captured exactly what the beaches look like there. It was foggy, but very beautiful. Plus, the cafe was friendly feeling and the stained glass was really pretty. The whale museum looked just like a real museum. Everything in this game was so realistic. And the music was really cheerful and nice, and it never got annoying or repetitive, which was great.\n\nPUZZLES - 5/5: The puzzles in this game were also wonderful. There was just enough so that you didn't feel like you were doing a puzzle every second, but you still always had something to do. Plus the puzzles were challenging, not so much that you get frustrated and want to quit, but just enough so that they're exciting and fun. That's another thing, the puzzles in this game were actually FUN, and as much as I enjoy this series, I can't say that a lot of the puzzles in the other games are fun. They're challenging, but not very much fun. But I can honestly say that I had a blast playing this game!\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING?: Yeah, it's just the right amount of challenge. It was hard, but not so hard that I got frustrated or tired of it. It was really just perfect, I'd give it a 4.5.\n\nENDING - 5/5: The ending was so exciting. Snooping around, I really felt like I was in danger of being caught. Plus there was a big twist at the end in terms of revealing the culprit. I was surprised how scary the culprit got at the end, they just looked so evil! Catching them was fun, it took me a while to figure it out, but once I did I was very pleased. It was a fantastic ending to a fantastic game!\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 5\nSetting: 5\nPuzzles: 5\nChallenge: 4.5\nEnding: 5\n= 29.5 divided by 6 = 4.9 rounded to 5</td><td>09 25, 2010</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>A New ND Favorite!</td><td>1285372800</td><td>true</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0000CEM5O</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is one of the best games in the series, I think, but there are just a few tiny issues I have with it, and therefore, I can not give it 5 stars.  However, this what I thought of it.\n\nStory-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of George's friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katie's boat.\n\nGraphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.\n\nSound-The music is not that upbeat.  It's rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, it's usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.\n\nGameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.\n\nFun-Other than that, the game's puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katie's boat.\n\nLength-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.\n\nThis is a near perfect game, but because of just a few flaws I have to take a star away.  Don't let that discourage you from getting it, though.

You can spend time out on the water in a kayak, eat a bowl of hearty chowder (or maybe a blueberry muffin) in the Hot Kettle Cafe, read about the local sea monster, build sand castles on a remote beach and dig for clams in the sand.\n\nThe only thing missing is maybe romance.

There was an error copying files and no matter what I did, it wouldn't fix it, even following HI's advice on the technical support board. Running the game from the disc rather than installing to my computer fixed the problem completely though.\n\nOverall, I think this one is the pinnacle of HI's goodness.\n\nIf you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you.

Pleased with so fine a product, I bought many over the years.  Certainly OS X (Panther) has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance.  But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before.  Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems.  I can now.  Before, I could find things.  And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders.  If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent.  I could see the folders open, one inside the other.  And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively.  No more.  In OS X, I haven't a clue.  I do have a 750-page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther.  With a trembling finger on the step-by-step instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully.  I know the red buttons close something-sometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window.  (Which I've learned to find after a brief but infuriating search.)  There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I can't say what they do just now.  It's all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason.  If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green?  Don't bother; logic is no guide in Panther.  And that encapsulates the problem.  In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized.  The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.  Try to console yourself with that tradeoff the next time you face the spinning beach ball of death.  Hint: Erase your hard-drive and re-install everything.  A rock after all is a rock.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the Dock.  I've read (several times) the twenty-page introduction that explains just how easy the Dock is to use.  I condensed all that to a half page of notes, which I've misplaced.  But the little icons do look nifty.  And they do bounce happily-like little corpses on deliberators.  In fact OS X has all the chrome gleam and high-tech awe of a modern hospital.  Yes it is wonderful how technology can keep a body alive on antibiotics, feeding tubes, and assisted breathing.

Even administrator tasks can be handled with ease. There are an abundance of setup utilities (\"wizards\") and familiar system preferences (like control panels.)\nThe Macintosh has always meant simplicity, ease of use, powerful utility and just plain fun. Panther continues the tradition and enhances the experience.\nShould you upgrade? Panther works for all G4 & G5 based Macs and MANY G3 systems. (PowerBook G3 Wallstreet and original PowerBook G3, G3 Beige and some other G3 systems are excluded from the supported systems list.) Essentially any G3 or higher Mac with built-in USB is supposedly supported. Panther has proven to be extremely stable. If you have a G5, Panther is almost essential to keep you up-to-date with all the hardware features and fixes becoming available.\nIf you have a G4, you PROBABLY want to get the upgrade to be sure to get the latest enhancements and fixes. Many of the graphical improvements require high-end graphic cards to see the benefit, though.\nIf you have a G3, first check to be sure your system is supported. Go to the Apple.com web page and select the \"Mac OS X\" tab. Then click on the \"Upgrade\" tab then select the link for \"Check the system requirements\". If your system passes muster, you may want to consider Panther because of the latest updates. You probably won't notice too many speed improvements or enhanced graphics capabilities. However, since it is a stable upgrade and has a number of useful new features it is worth considering.\nIf you have Internet access, getting updates is as simple as launching \"Software Updates\" from the Apple menu. There are many new features, outlined in the Amazon review and detailed at the Apple web site, \"Mac OS X\" tab, \"New Features\" tab.\nFor me, my favorite new features are Expos and Fast User Switching. With Expos, hit one function key and all your open windows slide aside so you can see your desktop. Hit a different key and all windows are visble, in miniature and aligned. Click on one of them and it pops to the top of the heap.\nFast user switching allows two (or more) separate users to use the same Mac at the same time. Each gets his/her own desktop and preferences. Select a user name from a new users menu at the top, right of the menu bar and enter that user's password and poof, your desktop becomes the other user's desktop. One user can log out and the other user can keep going. This is a real boon because both my wife and I are Mac addicts and still need to share one Mac (after all, isn't sharing what marriage is about?)\nOverall, I feel Panther is a worthwhile upgrade, but the price may be prohibitive to some.</td><td>03 3, 2004</td><td>A3GQSZ2RVVXDCZ</td><td>Jon Kreisler</td><td>null</td><td>Panther - An OS Come Of Age</td><td>1078272000</td><td>false</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>B0000E6NK9</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>A First Look - Mac OS X 10.3 \"Panther\"\nTim Robertson\nPublisher/Owner, Columnist, MacRelevant\nFriday, 10/24/03\nAs the masses await the Fed-Ex truck to deliver to their eager hands a copy of the latest Mac OS X release from Apple, Panther, MyMac.com presents our early, first-look at the eagerly awaiting OS.\nFirst impressions: Wow, this thing is fast! Running 10.3 on an Apple Macintosh G5 1.8GHz, we noticed a huge speed boost to almost every finder-level task. Opening windows, scrolling large directories, accessing other machines over the network, you name it, it seemed faster. But lets take a look at some of the unique features in Panther.\nExpos&eacute;. This is a very, very cool new feature that I am simply in love with. What does it do? Well, for the uninitiated, it gives you instant access to any open window from any program, including the finder. What Expos&eacute; does is makes every open window shrink on your screen, and you simply click the window you want to spring to the front. So what's the big deal, you ask? Unlike the old Application window in Mac OS 9, which will only show you the applications running, this shows you all your open windows. So if you have three Safari windows open (I never do, I am in love with Tabs now) this will let you see every window. What's more, when you put your cursor over the mini-windows, the name of the window is displayed. You really have to experience Expos&eacute; live to appreciate just how much it is going to change the way you use the Mac OS. The only drawback for me is that it does not show any windows you may have minimized to the dock.\nTo access Expos&eacute;, you first set it up in your system preferences pane. For myself, I have Expos&eacute; activate for all windows if I put my cursor in the upper-right hand of my screen. If I put my cursor in the lower right, only the front application (including the Finder) will show. By default, three F-Keys are also set to do the same. Even cooler, when you click F11, all open windows move out of the way to reveal the desktop, and stay out of the way until you call them back.\nIf you have a multi-button mouse, you can also assign mouse buttons to do the same. I personally use my extra mouse buttons to launch applications, but I could set it up so that the scroll wheel button moves everything out of the way for quick access to the desktop.\nExpos&eacute; is one of those application that, like I said, better experienced than explained. I cannot get over how useful this is to how I would with my Mac. If it were not part of the OS, I would call this the next Killer App for the Mac.\nHeads-up Application Switcher. This is yet another way to switch between applications without using Expos&eacute; or the Dock. Mac OS 9 also had it. All you do is hold down the command-tab keys to bring up a heads-up display of the open applications. You continue to hold down the command (Apple) key while you \"Tab\" to the application you want. I used the same method in Mac OS 9 for years, and fell in love with it. It is one of the most missed features for me in Mac OS X.\nWelcome Back Labels! Yes, you can, finally, use labels in Mac OS X. But this, my friends, is labels on steroids! Labels work in all three views, Icons, List, or Columns. In Icon view, the label is a rich full color, rounded around the text. The icon itself is not colored, as it was is Mac OS 9. In List view, the color again does not apply to the icon, but to the entire line of the item labeled, so that the rounded colored bar extends across the entire windows. The same is true for Column view, but when you have clicked the labeled folder, the triangle keeps the label color. These may seem like not such a big deal, but they really are. Many, many people used labels to help find items, or to mark items that are of special importance, and it is a much-welcomed re-introduction to the Mac OS. Like Expos&eacute;, you really have to see the new labels in action to appreciate them.\nMany people are all up in arms about the brushed metal look, which is used in all the iLife applications, now being carried throughout the finder as well. These worries are unfounded, in my opinion. While I actually like the look, you can toggle it off if you wish. You do, however, loose some of the new functionality of finder windows if you do. Rather than having application folders, favorite folders, document folder etc&Eacute; at the top of each window, they are all now on the far left of your open windows. And they are all customizable. Personally, I think the new windows in Panther are a welcome improvement over the previous OS X windows.\nOne neat, though small, new feature is Apple put the often-used \"Software Update\" in the Apple menu. Clicking this simply opens the Software Update pane, but it does save one step in the process. A small update, sure, but one I have already gotten used to. And as the Apple menu is unchanged system-wide, you are always one click away from it.\nFast Switching. What is this? Well, if you share your computer with others, you will probably want to have multiple users accounts set up. A staple since the first release of Mac OS X, it was easy to switch to a different user. Now, however, it is even faster. When you activate \"Enable Fast User Switching\" in the \"Accounts\" pane in System Preferences, it puts the current users name in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It also puts in all the other names of any other user of your Mac. In my case, I have a \"Basic\" in which the system is basically as it would be fresh from the store. I also have one for my wife (even though she uses her own iMac, not my G5) and one named \"Kids\" which is for, obviously, my kids. (All they can do is create pictures in Illustrator or Photoshop, type up letters, and use Safari with bookmarks my wife and I approve, all others all deleted.)\nSo what happens when you click one of those names? You entire screen rotates; bring that user to the front. If the name is password protected, in brings up the log-on screen. And best of all, you can leave your account just as it is, with all the applications running, and switch users. When you switch back, everything is just as you left it. This is amazing technology I don't think enough people utilize.\nAll in all, Panther is a great OS. Of course, there will be some applications that will not run correctly and need updating, but that is true for any major OS upgrade. I am very, very pleased with Mac OS X 10.3, and think that for those with a newer machine, you will appreciate the added speed benefits and stability. The new features all work really well, and I look forward to delving deeper into Panther in the coming months.\nTim Robertson</td><td>11 29, 2003</td><td>A1VLVWTLV3LVHR</td><td>Tim Robertson</td><td>null</td><td>Tim Robertson MyMac.com First Look</td><td>1070064000</td><td>false</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>B0000E6NK9</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've been running OS X on my G4 Powerbook for over a year now, and I love it.\nJaguar 10.2.8 was running great so there was no stability reason for me to upgrade. Basically I just had to have the latest version just because it is the latest type of thing. Yes the system is quicker and there are some useful features such as expose, but I'm not sure it was worth the cost of the upgrade.\nIf Apple is planning on upgrading OS X every year then I probably could have gone along with 10.2.8 with no complaints and done a upgrade on the next version. I think Apple should have offered a upgrade version for those with 10.2 for about half the cost of what is charged for Panther. To pay full price for a OS  you expect major changes, like from Windows 98 to Windows XP.\nSo if you are happy with 10.2 and the new features in 10.3 are not something you need then I would stay with your current version and see what comes along next year.

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This \"smart-switch\" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.\n\nDesign:\nOne of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.\n\nThe click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.\n\nThe 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.\n\nThe 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.\n\nThe interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no \"power brick\" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.\n\nThe included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.\n\nConfiguration:\nI downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.\n\n' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.\n' Change the password - The default password is \"password\", so change it to something better!\n\nThe Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.\n\nThe advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:\n' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)\n' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)\n' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).\n' Port by port Rate limiting\n' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a \"disable\" setting to turn a port off if desired)\n' Port by port Broadcast Filtering\n' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)\n' Multicast control via IGMP snooping\n' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)\n\nNote: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n\nMost users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n\nGreen Power Use:\nThe 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n\nSupport:\nI did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n\nThe switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n\nI had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years.

I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n\nInstallation\n\nYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n\nHardware\n\nAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n\nThe array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n\nOne HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n\nI did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n\nA nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n\nDuring my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.</td><td>03 26, 2012</td><td>A2UL0DVTM8KVNV</td><td>R.

After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.

I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.</td><td>01 21, 2010</td><td>AR4NKM7NXG92G</td><td>A. B.

Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.

This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says \"T7Hub\" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for \"permanent\" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.

It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.</td><td>12 19, 2007</td><td>A37VWMG8U0OP41</td><td>Eric Thorson</td><td>null</td><td>Expensive but worth it for my uses!</td><td>1198022400</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001FS9NE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Easy to install on XP machine, drivers worked great.\n\nLoaded quickly and easily, and worked!\n\nWhat else could you ask for?</td><td>11 21, 2007</td><td>A2E6P8E66HNRRC</td><td>R.

I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.\n\nThat device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).\n\nI wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.\n\nA bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.\n\nSetup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).\n\nAnother bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.\n\nThe downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive \"ethernet to Wi-Fi\" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.\n\nThe PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang \"g\") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps \"turbo\" mode in 802.11a!

When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.

It started early, in Message in a Haunted Mansion, and has been used poorly often (Trail of the Twister, Icicle Creek -- making the food, not the maid work, etc), but in this game it works. On a ranch, everyone pitches in. And really, the only thing you have to pitch in and do is collect eggs and vegetables, set up a camp fire, and feed the horses.\n\nActually, the camp fire was the only time I cheated, because I couldn't figure out where to get the kindling. I totally glanced over the true source because I thought it was part of the scenery, so I had a good laugh when I looked at the cheat. Don't make my mistake players. It's right in front of your nose, I promise.\n\nThe only 'chore' I didn't like was the one that had nothing to do with the ranch, though it was also fair. You do something for the lady at the shop, and she does something for you in return. I just wish it hadn't been so trying to collect all the arrowheads. Though here's a word to the wise: You can collect them at any time. So when you see one in the game, pick it up. That way you have less work later.\n\nAs a game, I'd highly recommend it to new comers to the series. It isn't my favorite, but that's mostly because my favorites, if you look at them, generally follow the same pattern (find secret passageways!). The story is beautiful, the 'dudes' are great (and so are the incriminating side stories that all three of them get), I loved riding on Bob (the horse), and it was just an all around good adventure-mystery.</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>null</td><td>This is the game where the chores aren't a bore.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Owning nearly every game in the Nancy Drew PC series, I'd have to say that one of the many things that HERInteractive excels at is the absence of repetition; Each and every one of their games feels unique and is lots of fun, although some may be more enjoyable than other ones. This one also has a unique location, a ranch in the Arizona desert. While sleuthing and the wild west don't seem like a match in your mind, this game is definitely an amazing edition to the series, and deserves a spot on any detective's game shelf.\n\nStory: 9/10. This game pretty much has two stories. There's the fact that a glowing white horse gallops past the ranch occasionally at night, and when it does, bad things start to happen. There's also the story that an outlaw named Dirk Valentine left treasure somewhere at or near the ranch. As the game went on, the two stories somewhat started to meld together, and it was super exciting seeing Dirk Valentine's treasure hunt progress.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 9/10. For a game that's seven years old, the graphics are still pretty decent even by HERInteractive standards today. Sure, the characters movements are still robotic in this one, but the scenery makes up for it; Which brings me to one of the big highlights of this game, the setting. It was such an incredible idea to put Nancy Drew in the wild west and shortly live the life of a cow girl. The music was absolutely perfect for the setting, and it was a very realistic experience for a pc game.\n\nAtmosphere: 9.5/10. Definitely the best atmosphere of any game up to this point, and possibly of the whole series. The AMAZING music fit the game perfectly, and the backgrounds (not the real pictures), were very realistic, and although I played this game on a computer like all other games in this series, I felt somewhat attached to the game's atmosphere\n\nCharacters: 8.5/10. The characters were decent this time around. You have three very different cowboys, and Mary Yazzie, a store owner a couple of miles away from the ranch. They each had their own distinct personalities, I just wish they'd shined through more often.\n\nPuzzles: 8/10. Not way too many puzzles this time around, which for me was definitely a positive. Most of them fit the game, and were a good balance in terms of difficulty.\n\nEnding: 9/10. A somewhat surprising and creepy ending. It's pretty simple, but still took me a few second chances to end the game.\n\nTotal (averaged): 8.83 out of 10, rounded to....\n\n9/10.\n\nA truly unique and enjoyable Nancy Drew game, the atmosphere and story is top notch, and this game deserves a spot on any Nancy Drew fan's shelf.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>null</td><td>Secret of Shadow Ranch review</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>After so many solid installments, one must wonder, \"what will the 10th milestone be like?\" I wondered myself back when this game first came out, as almost every game before this one had been a delight. When I finally played the game, it never failed to amaze me.\n\nNancy's going to Arizona with Bess and George, to visit her friends' Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed at their new ranch in Phoenix. Nancy arrives before Bess and George (whose flights are consistently delayed), only to find that strange things have been happening at Shadow Ranch lately. According to legend, the horse of an outlaw named Dirk Valentine haunts the ranch, cursing those who see it with bad luck. After it appeared the night before Nancy's arrival, a rattlesnake was found in Ed and Bet's room and bit Ed! When it looks like these attacks seem to be choreographed, Nancy starts seeking the truth behind this phantom horse, its history, and the truth about what happened to a legendary treasure that Dirk left for his love who lived on Shadow Ranch years ago...\n\nThe story became very gripping, and just who the culprit was going to be at the end was truly a mystery (pun slightly intended). There were quite a number of twists and turns that I never saw coming, but all were very tastefully handled. Overall, I'd say this game has one of the best stories (and I'd hope so - it *is* based on the bestselling Nancy Drew book of all time).\n\nThe graphics were definitely the best upon the release of this game, and still continue to rival several of the more recently-released games. The characters are all wonderfully animated, and their gestures and body language is very realistic. The scenery was very detailed, and everything appeared almost as if it would if it were encountered in real life. I also liked how the phantom horse was animated whenever it appeared.\n\nAll of the characters were rather likable, in the cases of both the phone friends and the suspects. Eventually, all of the suspects grew on me, to the point that I'd be disappointed no matter who the culprit was. They were so lovable, and remain one of the best casts to appear in a Nancy Drew game yet.\n\nThe suspects include Dave Gregory, the foreman of the ranch who seems very shy whenever he's around Nancy. Shorty Thurmond is the cook, who's as opposite to Dave as night is from day with his consistently running mouth and love of gossip. Tex Britten is the head wrangler, and has a very creepy aura and personality about him. Mary Yazzi is the first Native American character to appear in a Nancy Drew game, and she runs her own store on land adjacent to Shadow Ranch. They all fit together nicely, and the amount of interaction they have with Nancy is not only exceptional, but also the interaction they have with each other. Nearly all of them have something to say about each other, and we get to really understand how they get along with each other as well as with Nancy. This was such an awesome idea, as it makes the case much more believable and the characters all the more real and able to be related to.\n\nThe puzzles and challenges were pretty enjoyable. Several were challenging, but not impossible. My favorites were the mini games in Mary's shop and in Dry Creek (a ghost town that appears later on) and the cake baking challenge. I didn't really care for maze and flowers puzzles because they were exceptionally difficult, but two out of several isn't all that bad.\n\nI don't typically care for country music, so the soundtrack didn't stand out quite as much to me. However, this is just a personal taste, not a set-in-stone rule. Besides, the game *does* take place on a ranch. The soundtrack for this game should sound Western, right? So, regardless of the fact that I don't typically care for country, I have to say that the soundtrack is still as fitting and awesome as ever.\n\nWhile \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\" does have a few setbacks, it's a very strong Nancy Drew game. I'd say it still holds up as one of the best, especially in terms of characterization and plot development. It earned its spot in the top 3 games packaged in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites package, alongside \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" and \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\". Even though it's not a top five game for me, it's definitely a top ten that's well worth hopping onto and riding to the player's content.</td><td>06 28, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>null</td><td>An Epic Ride into the Shadows...</td><td>1309219200</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is the 3rd Nancy Drew game I've played (my previous two were #12 and #13) and I can't say its my favorite.

I'm going to split by review up into sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 4/5: Nancy is invited to Shadow Ranch, which belongs to Bess and George's aunt and uncle, the Rawleys.. But when she gets there, Bess and George are a no-show, and the Rawleys are in the hospital after Mr. Rawley got bitten by a rattlesnake. Nancy then learns that a mysterious glowing horse has been making nightly appearances at the ranch, and that everytime it shows up, a freak accident happens. She also learns about a outlaw named Dirk Valentine who, in the 1800's, was in love with a girl who lived on Shadow Ranch, and supposedly left her a hidden treasure somewhere. Could Dirk Valentine's treasure have something to do with the horse? Is there really a treasure? Who will stop the horse before something really bad happens? Well, it's up to you, as Nancy Drew!\n\nThis is practically the same plot as Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon (I guess it would be the other way around, cause this game came out first, but I played Last Train first so it's backwards for me) so it didn't really catch my attention. The plot was executed pretty well, though, but I still prefer Last Train. Everyone says how much fun the horseback riding was, but I didn't think it was that cool. You just point and click, same as always, except theres a horse head in front of you. But I will admit that by the end of the game, my horse Bob and I were pretty tight.\n\nCHARACTERS - 4/5: The characters were good in this game. They weren't really THAT much fun to talk to (except Bess and George), but some of them were intersting. Tex is the horse wrangler guy, he's tough, mean, down-right scary looking, and he doesn't have much to say. Mary Yazzie owns the gift store near the ranch, her character was boring and her voice was really annoying. The cook, Shorty, was nice, it was funny how he always wanted to gossip with Nancy, but I thought he was creepy looking, like a big scary teddy bear. The foreman, Dave, was quiet, but it was really sweet how he had a crush on Nancy. And Charleena wasn't that cool cause all you did was talk to her on the phone. Overall, I think they did a good job on the characters, they weren't amazing, but the voice acting was good (except Mary IMO) and the graphics for them were also good.\n\nSETTING - 4.5/5: This game is set in Arizona, and I think that the makers of this game did a great job getting that desert feeling. The decorations in the house were just perfect, and the ranch looked so realistic. The ghost town was pretty spooky, and the desert was barren, as it should be. The only problem I had with the setting was the music! The song was good at first but then it just got really annoying and repetitive. I would give the setting a 5 but for the song I'm gonna have to knock off half a point.\n\nPUZZLES - 2/5: If you were to ask me what was the ONE thing that bothered me about this game, I wouldn't hesitate a second to say CHORES!!! I hated them! Fixing the wire and collecting the eggs wasn't so bad, but picking those vegetables, AHHH! I got sent home like 20 times for picking unripe vegetables. I mean really, who sends a guest home for picking an unripe tomato? I ended up printing out like a map of the garden from a walkthrough so that I knew which vegetables to pick. But those chores were just a total turn off. I felt like some of the other puzzles in the game were also hard, I spent like an hour trying to do that impossible magnet thing, then another hour hunting for arrowheads on the ground. It was just ridiculous. I don't know, mabye there were some really fun puzzles in this game, but I can't remember them cause all I remember is that awful garden. The puzzles in this game are really not my cup of tea.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING?: YES! Unless if your an expert at collecting vegetables, baking cakes, spending hours searching the ground for arrowheads, and solving invisible puzzles. I'd give it a 5/5 for challenge, but it's not challenging in a fun way.\n\nENDING - 4/5: The ending is good. The maze at the end is confusing, definitely challenging. And if it weren't for a walkthrough I wouldn't have ever guessed how to catch the culprit. I was kind of surprised by who the culprit was and what their motive was. Overall the ending was good.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 4\nCharacters:4\nSetting: 4.5\nPuzzles: 2\nChallenge: 5\nEnding: 4\n= 23.5 divided by 6 = 3.91, I'll give it a 4 overall, but a 3 for fun.</td><td>09 7, 2010</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>null</td><td>Saddle up for...Chores?</td><td>1283817600</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>One thing I realized when I bought this game was that this seemed to be a good game just like the past 4-5, but HERinteractive wasn't really improving them to \"great.\"  I still liked this game, but I kept expecting HERinteractive to step it up.\n\nStory-Bess and George's Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed invite you (along with Bess and George) to their ranch in Arizona.  When you arrive, Bess, George, Aunt Bet, and Uncle Ed are all not there; and the hired hands won't tell you anything.  You soon find out that a \"phantom horse\" has been showing up, and everytime it shows up something bad happenns.  The latest catastrophe is that Uncle Ed got bitten by a rattlesnake and had to go to the ER.\n\nGraphics-Just a little bit better.  I keep expecting it to just get WOW better, but it never does.  The lips actually match the words much better, though.\n\nSound-Along with that, the voice acting for one of the characters you talk to is fabulous, while the other three characters seem bored.  This is actually the first game where I felt some voice actors/actresses weren't giving it their all.  The music is country which I didn't really like or dislike.  It went with the story, so that was good enough for me.\n\nGameplay-Everything is the same (first person; point-and-click; etc.) except you get around via horse.  It actually takes longer than in other games, and it can get quite boring.  Another boring thing are the \"puzzles.\"  Half of the puzzles are chores such as getting the eggs, feeding the horses, etc.  It's not brain-challenging at all, and for this reason I gave the \"fun rating\" 3 stars.\n\nFun-Like I said this game is OK, but the puzzles aren't really fun.  The story is fun, though, expecially the back story with Bess and George, but the puzzles are just work.  I hate work.\n\nLength-This game is about 10 hours straight through.  However, I wish they would have taken out the chores even if it resulted in lowering the game to 8 hours.  Seriously, the chores take about 2 hours in total.\n\nA good game that has boring puzzles.  With this game I was really wanting HERinteractive to come out with something great; unfortunately, the didn't.  I gave it four stars only because the story was great, and I loved the other half of puzzles that actually required the brain.</td><td>12 15, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>null</td><td>Nancy Drew goes to the country</td><td>1260835200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The Crime: A -\n\nBess and George's Aunt Bet have chucked their life in Phoenix and bought Shadow Ranch.

What's going on here?\n\nSuspects include cook Shorty Thurmond, store owner Mary Yazzie, and ranch hands Tex and Dave.\n\nFun fact - Mary Yazzie's character was named Mary Deer in the book. I don't know why they changed it.\n\nBy this point in the series, I was looking for something meatier than yet another tale of buried treasure and phantom animals.\n\nThe story is just too dang engaging to be ignored, though.

And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldn't think of anything better, either.\n\nGameplay: A +\n\nThe new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access.

Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. It's divine.\n\nTime Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.\n\nVoice Acting: A\n\nRaspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend.

The reason I did not give \"Secret\" 5 stars is because a few of the puzzles, such as having to collect vegetables and eggs twice are just plain boring. However, you get a real feel for the old west as the graphics are excellent. The Indian relics and ruins and the ghost town are very well done and the indoor scenes are great, such as Shadow Ranch Lodge, Mary's Gift shop and Cappy's, the remnant of an old saloon.\n\nThe horse lore that you will learn such as the proper term for each horse color is downright interesting. And as a ranch hand you'll be obliged to put a dismembered bridle together, feed the three horses and the chickens their various rations, bake a cake, run a barrel race and ride your faithful horse Bob to interesting places, sleuthing all the way.\n\nThe puzzles cover a pretty wide gamut of difficulty from the very easy (the vegetables and eggs and the chicken wire fence repair) to the reasonably hard-the Indian ruins maze. The number and variety of puzzles should please just about everybody except, perhaps, accomplished and sophisticated gamers. The latter would find \"The Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" a much bigger challenge for their abilities.\n\nThe voice acting is first rate and the lip synch and gestures are fine. Tex, the onery cowboy with an incredibly deep voice, is very funny. Dave, another ranch hand, is very cute, as Nancy noticed and points out. All and all \"Secrets of Shadow Ranch\" is a very pleasant experience, and even though it took me about ten tries to trick the culprit at the end (I get in such a flap when a puzzle is timed) I finally succeeded.

The reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time I've done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isn't any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult \"UHS Hints\" (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...\n\n\"Shadow Ranch\" is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).\n\nNancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...\n\nIn order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!\n\nOverall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, I'd recommend going to the \"UHS hints\" website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before you're given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you don't have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.</td><td>12 18, 2005</td><td>A1N2L9A6I686G5</td><td>Katie</td><td>null</td><td>Another Good Game!</td><td>1134864000</td><td>true</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The life on a ranch is not as easy as it looks.

However, Nancy arrives at the airport to a less-than-warm welcome from a ranch hand, only to find that Ed Rawley was bitten by a rattlesnake and is in hospital.  As if that wasn't enough excitement, cousins Bess and George are stranded at the airport due to bad weather, so Nancy has to explore by herself.\n\nA phantom horse has been sighted on the ranch just before bad things happen (broken pipes, downed power lines, rattlesnake bites),and it's up to teenage supersleuth Nancy to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding a historical romance that unfolded on the ranch between Frances Humber, daughter of the local sheriff, and outlaw Dirk Valentine.  Before he died, Dirk buried his treasure for Frances to find using a series of hidden clues, and the treasure remains somewhere on ranch property.  Besides Shadow Ranch, Nancy gets to explore a canyon full of petroglyphs, a Native American shop, a ghost town, and abandoned cave dwellings.\n\nThere are a number of suspects: Dave the ranch hand, Tex the head wrangler, Shorty the cook, and Mary Yazzie, a Native American jeweler. Nancy meets other characters over the phone, including a famous novelist, the local sheriff, and the Rawleys.\n\nSeveral new features have been added, including a larger game window, which I liked, although navigating a full inventory could be confusing at times.  Nancy gets to learn about horses, barrel racing and how to use a lariat.  To get from place to place (there are six major locations), Nancy rides Bob the quarter horse.  Nancy can search for information on the web with her cell phone, which provides numerous hints as to how to solve puzzles. There is a strong educational element here, as Nancy sifts through information on not only ranch life (cattle branding, barrel racing, picking vegetables, feeding horses), but numerous other topics (knitting, agates, petroglyphs, flowers).\n\nI liked the nature of the puzzles, although many reviewers complained about the repetitive chores, including daily egg collecting, vegetable picking, cake baking, and feeding the animals.  Nancy is expected to help out during her visit by performing tasks for various characters, including putting together a bridle, collecting eggs and vegetables, arranging a jewelry display, and collecting arrowheads.  There are a fair number of slider puzzles and several mazes. This game is more difficult than others in the series but not as hard as Secret of Blackmoor Manor.\n\nSecret of Shadow Ranch had a very strong story, good character development, excellent music (Spanish guitar, country western, scary music in the ghost town that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck), improved graphics, well integrated puzzles, and a satisfying conclusion (which I didn't find in Secret of Blackmoor Manor).

I suspect that Microsoft is partially trying to install some Vista style features ( ripped off from Apple ). In particular, I have seen Apple style \"sliding down\" menu boxes or whatever they are called. As an example, open the \"control panel\" applet. BEFORE, it was accessible, NOW, the elements at the top of the left column \"slide\" down. I had enough bad seizures ( bad in this case means very unpleasant - I can actually feel them in my brain ) that, after experimenting trying to disable this abomination, at had to get away from the computer.\n\nFor people like me, my computer is my lifeline. Since Macs are absolutely not accessible, we are stuck with Microsoft Windows XP. Vista is absolutely not accessible, as is Leopard, etc. With Microsoft destroying the minimal accessibility of XP, there is nowhere to go.\n\nIF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL SP3 - FULLY BACKUP YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN REVERT TO SP2 IF YOU HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ( I have two notebooks; if I cannot figure out a workaround, then I will never be able to install SP3 )\n\nBTW, I review so that other people like me can find information about products to avoid and so that they can realize that the problems that they are having are common to other people. There is essentially no accessibility any more. It is so bad that it is only a matter of years before we can no longer live in this society due to blinking, flashing, etc.\n\nWorkaround:\nControl Panel | System | Advanced | Performance - SETTINGS\nUnclick EVERYTHING that allows animation, fading, sliding, etc. I am not sure how comprehensive this will be but it helps.\n\nBTW, FULL accessibility demands that the display be totally \"quiet\" as far as any unnecessary motion or blinking. Unnecessary features that make Windows XP inaccessible are, in particular, \"progress bars\", animations for copying files. Microsoft Word has major accessibility problems. The animations associated with spell checking ( the IDIOT animated book icon at the bottom of the screen - every time you type the animations start.

With the introduction of SP2 in this minor update of Windows XP, Microsoft has decided to make the product \"secure\", than it was thought to be in the beginning. But the past few years have been rough on Microsoft, with consistency in attacks on the product with such vulnerabilities as Trojans, buffer overflows, viruses and the most memorable of the all Blaster (August 2003).\n\nEver since its debut, Windows XP has been causing a lot of headaches and wreaking havoc on corporate networks because of its susceptibility vulnerabilities that were not fixed in its initial release or Service Pack 1. So Microsoft decided to go back to the drawing board and decided to rethink what Windows XP should mean in terms of Security. At first Service Pack 2 was thought out to only be a minor Service Pack update with usual bug fixes, but because of the aforementioned problems Microsoft took new direction and after 1 year of testing we have finally reached a conclusion.\n\nSP2 is really apparent, based on my experience of installing the update, users displayed a welcome screen recommending Automatic Updates be turned on (and I would recommend too), after which the user is presented with the Security Center where you can configure the new and improved Firewall settings, such as which programs can access your PC. You also have the option of configuring your Anti-Virus program, unfortunately I have not been able to do so because my Anti-virus is not supported, although it seems (Norton Anti-virus Corporate Edition 7.6). Security Center is really the big change here and should have been implemented from beginning, but better late than never.\n\nOther great features which I and many users are undoubtedly thankful for include the Pop-Blocker which should have been included in IE 6 from the beginning (better late than never), its not 100 % percent effective but does a decent job so far of blocking most annoying Pop-Ups. I wish the Windows Team allowed users to train it, so if a Pop does succeed, you can tell the pop-up blocker engine that was a pop-up window and you shouldn't let that pass the next time, maybe Microsoft will let it improve over time. Other great improvements to IE in SP2 is the ability approve programs, so drive by downloads have become a thing of the past, anything you decide to download or accidentally clicked on a webpage has to be approved.\n\nAnother wish is, better integration of the ActiveX controls with Microsoft's own technologies, I notice that when I had to do a Office Update, the ActiveX API engine on Microsoft's Office website had to be approved before I run the utility that checked for updates for Office products I needed.\n\nMicrosoft has also streamlined Windows Update to be more user-friendly, you the user have the option for a Express or Custom install, Express only installs the most critical updates, while Custom allows to install the entire kitchen sink, including stuff some users can do without on Windows, (go with Express). Windows XP SP2 includes minor enhancements such as Windows Media Player 9, but why didn't Microsoft just wait a little longer and included Windows Media Player 10, which is already out? The blue tooth update is also a needed update, it wasn't intuitive right out of the box, but is more user friendly, all this, you can get for free if you are existing XP owner.\n\nOverall, if you haven't upgraded to Windows XP yet from older versions of Windows, this is the time, but if you are an existing Windows XP user, I say skip this and just order the SP2 CD or download it from the Windows XP Website. I highly recommend users running prior versions of XP especially 95, 98, 98 SE, NT 4 and ME, maybe 2000 also move to XP, since Microsoft is planning on porting any of technologies in XP to those older versions of Windows, plus it has some great new features and you will love the Security technologies that provide a better experience for you the user.

This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.\n\nMost important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.\n\nTrue enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.\n\nAfter the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.\n\nThroughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2.

But when you click on \"other versions\", you're quickly told that all Powerquest products (that is, any partition magic version < 8) are \"obsolete\" and \"unsupported\". They got rid of all the updates for PQMagic versions 3 to 7. Obviously Symantec is only interested in new sales and the dollars, not supporting former Powerquest customers (Partition Magic 7.0 is even listed and in stock for sale on Amazon.com!).\n\nPQMagic and Powerquest Drive Image have been always superior to Symantec's Ghost products.

Welcome to the Symantec partition resizing utility monopoly!. Symantec got rid of their main competitor and destroyed a product in the process. It's just sad.

Despite all the monopolizing and heavy-handedness and rushed updates, I have always felt they did more good than harm.  I have yet to find a Microsoft product I didn't like... until now.\n\nIn a word, Microsoft Money 2005 is \"horrible\".  I only gave it 2 stars because it still beats paper and pen :)\n\nNow, if you're a new user, you probably won't notice anything bad about it and will continue on your merry way.  Bravo for you (just don't do anything online until they release the second patch (yes, there's already one out) since 2005 is apparently quite broken with respect to about 50% of the institutions it claims to support).\n\nIf you're a previous Money user, pocket your $30 and invest it, using your old version to track the savings.  I was terribly disappointed in 2005.  To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, \"dual category lists\", \"in-register\" spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone.  What have they been replaced with?  I have no clue.  As far as I can tell, they've replaced them with a HUGE toolbar (a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize) and a LOT of white space (the register displays about 30 lines max (on \"compressed\" view) and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen.)\n\nThe home page actually displays less information (though it is prettier in a way) and the settings \"menu\" is a fiasco (again, much like MSN Explorer) with numerous hyperlinks that are not necessarily intuitive.\n\nFrom what I could tell, reconciliation seemed to work as expected, but seemed to offer less information than 2003 did.  I did not even take the time to get into investing since I uninstalled 2005 within 24 hours (and I am, without doubt, a \"give it time\" kind of person).  I honestly felt like I had less control over my finances (or at least less information with which to make informed decisions) and didn't want to risk botching up my portfolio.\n\nThat's about it.  I know it's a short review and probably leaves many questions unanswered, but I had only invested 24 hors in 2005 so a \"roll back\" to 2003 was fairly straightforward (and evidently necessary).  To take more time would have meant a more difficult reversal.  Again, I normally like MS products, but I can promise you this one will be going back to Redmond at their expense (30-day Money Back Guarantee).\n\nI would STRONGLY recommend against buying Money 2005.  It just isn't worth the money (I honestly wouldn't even take it free now).  I can see no enhanced functionality and it actually appears reduced in places.  The interface has been radically changed and, aside from being pretty, actually reduced my sense of \"control\" over my finances.  Again, if you're brand new to Microsoft Money, I think you'll be satisfied.  However, if you're a previous user... well... you've been warned...\n\nPS Did I tell you that Money automatically (read: \"Did not ask\") reorganized my categories?  It decided to treat \"Dining out\" as its own primary category instead of as a subcategory of \"Food\", effectively reorganizing over 100 transactions.  This might have been OK if Money had asked, but it didn't.  Makes me wonder what else was changed without my approval...</td><td>09 22, 2004</td><td>AAJIGWE242MSN</td><td>CJS</td><td>null</td><td>Stick with your old version and use it to track the savings</td><td>1095811200</td><td>false</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>B0002D12D4</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>There is a small army of people who, like the recalcitrant insurgents in Iraq, will do anything to try to destroy Microsoft's reputation.

As with any company, it makes some great products, many good products, and some bad products.\n\nI did not upgrade to Microsoft Money 2004 because, sometime in 2003, my Money file developed some kind of minor corruption (\"This operation cannot be performed\" error after entering certain types of transactions), and Money 2004 refused to even read the file.  This time, I downloaded the trial version of Money 2005, and it loaded the old-format file without a hitch.  And the mysterious error message is no more!\n\nMoney is cool because it makes it easy to keep track of your accounts, esp. for someone like me with dozens of banking and brokerage accounts (many from the days of Internet bubble when banks were giving away free money for opening accounts -- I knew I needed a real job...).  It's generates useful reports to track your networth, by category or over time.  Even for someone like me with lots of small accounts but little to show in the aggregate, it's immensely useful.\n\nShould you get Money 2005, or upgrade from an earlier version?\n\nI can't really help you with that question.  But I do have a couple suggestions:\n\n1) Download the 30-day trial copy of the program from Microsoft's website and give it a test drive.  I tried it on my two laptops and both copies worked perfectly, which led me to doubt the truthfulness of a lof of these reviews from so-called \"I'm not anti-Microsoft\" people.  (No, yours truly doesn't work for Microsoft or get paid by them in any way.)\n\n2) For a peace of mind, make a manual backup copy of your existing Money file in Windows Explorer.  Just go into My Computer or Windows Explorer, find the Money file (it's usually in \"My Documents\"; its extension is \".mny\"), and use copy-and-paste to make a copy.  Keep the backup copy in a different folder.  Better yet, zip the backup copy for extra security. :)\n\nTry the program and judge for yourself if it works fine on your PC.  Not all the naysayers are liars, no doubt.  But, as I always advice my friends when they ask about gadgets, movies and whatnot, always try it yourself and form your own opinions.</td><td>01 31, 2005</td><td>A5JLAU2ARJ0BO</td><td>Old-and-Wise</td><td>null</td><td>Works for me, although interface still not the best</td><td>1107129600</td><td>false</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>B0002D12D4</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>The reviews for Money 2005 are very good -- I suggest reading them all to see what you're in for.\n\nThe big problems for me were:\n\n1) The ability to have separate category and subcategory lists was removed from the transaction form\n\n2) I couldn't easily use the 'Transfer' category, especially in a split category\n\n3) Annoying duplicate account creation\n\nOn the first problem, Money 2005 uses just one combined category-subcategory list, so when you enter a transaction, you must choose a category-subcategory from one big list.  I prefer two distinct selections because it's quicker to enter and easier to find my subcategories.  Microsoft provides a Registery edit in the following Knowledgebase article:\n\n[...]\n\nI used the edit, and my separate lists are restored.  Great, but I am irritated that Money 2005 removed this option and provided no way for a user to change this behavior short of a Registery hack.\n\nOn the 2nd problem, my ability to 'Transfer' amounts to different account was resolved once I split my subcategory lists from my category lists using the above Registery hack.  Now, transfers operate as they did in Money 2003, which is the last version I was using.\n\nOn the 3rd problem, one financial institution has, for the 2nd time, downloaded duplicate accounts.  I hope it's an anomoly, but we'll see.  Other accounts operate fine.\n\nI haven't explored the strengths of 2005 yet -- this was just post-upgrade issues I've wrestled with over the New Year's weekend.  On the surface, doesn't look like much new is useful to me.\n\nOn the matter of online bill payment, I already had that through Wachovia bank (formerly First Union).  I guess what's new is that Microsoft now makes bill payment through Money work with many institutions.  Since Wachovia already provided this function, I don't think I'm adversely affected...or benefitted (though Wachovia dropped the $6 monthly fee for using Money's bill payment function).\n\nOne final piece of advice:  after you install, don't open your Money data file unless/until you have had Money perform all its software updates.  For me, I opened my Money 2003 file, was prompted to convert to Money 2005 file format, and then Money 2005 automatically downloaded software patches afterwards.  Wondering whether my conversion worked right nor not, I chose to open a backup of my Money 2003 data file using the patched copy of Money 2005, so any software bug fixes related to data conversion were already installed in Money 2005.\n\nI gave it a 2-star rating based solely on the upgrade process.

I truly hadn't thought that I would get much use out of this, but tapping f12 to check in on the weather report or look up the exact definition of a word has become something I do regularly.\n\nSpotlight works wonderfully to find practically any information that you could want on your computer, and it finds it amazingly fast. It brings back results that are both faster and more useful than any other hard drive searching method I've come across.\n\nAutomator is something that mostly power users are going to love, but it's a relatively simple way to make a series of actions you might do frequently into a process that you initiate and the computer takes care of the rest.\n\nFor those who like to develop applications or just try out writing a little bit of code, Tiger also includes a copy of the latest version of xCode, which is rapidly gaining popularity for developing OS X software (and it can easily be used to write and modify code in languages like Java that will run on other systems as well).\n\nThere's a long list of other improvements, though many of them are deep enough in the system that a casual user won't immediately notice them.  What you will notice is that the applications you use are running faster than ever, because while Apple has released CoreAudio and CoreVideo so that developers can make better use of your video and soundcards and get some of the audiovisual load off of your processor.\n\nOS X Tiger is now up to version 10.4.1, with 10.4.2 rumored to be in the pipeline on its way to release.

The Dashboard is my favorite feature - I use it constantly, for everything from looking things up on Amazon.com to posting to my Blogger account. The new Spotlight search is wonderful- if it can't find it, it's not on your computer.\n\nNaturally, you want to back up your data before you install Tiger. However, I found that all of the warnings I got about using the \"erase and install\" option were unfounded. I used the simple \"upgrade\" option to install it and it was completely trouble free. The only caveat I've found so far is that my third party software registrations were invalidated, but that happens with most OS changes.\n\nI haven't had a crash yet. The system doesn't get bogged down as quickly when I have a lot of windows open as it did in Panther. Even my non-Apple software seems to work more efficiently. I really recommend this upgrade for anyone who is less than thrilled with Panther.</td><td>05 7, 2005</td><td>A2V4P6IRCK1P70</td><td>Morgaine Swann</td><td>List(null,  Software, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Awesome!

This security suite hogs the computer's resources and wraps itself around it so you can't get rid of it easily. In essence, this software is the worse virus that ever hit my PC. I was shocked when I counted almost 100 threads belonging to this internet suite when the PC was idle. 100 threads!!! Especially if you have an older PC, or one with not a lot of available resources, this software will slow it down to a crawl.\n\nAnother issue is when Live Update fails or does not complete for whatever reason (PC crash, reboot, out of disc, internet connection disrupted, etc), there is a chance this software suite will start behaving unpredictably. This is ironic since this is the software suite that is supposed to be protecting your computer, yet it cannot reliably update itself when there are problems during the update.\n\nPerhaps their notion of protection is to slow your PC down to a grind, so if a virus or hacker manages to break through, it will be so slow they won't be able to do a lot of damage - this is my attempt at humor :-)\n\nBut to be fair, this suite seems to work most of the time. I did not have any viruses or firewall breaches - at least as far as I can tell. It has some level of customization and control, although you cannot turn off some of their annoying reminders. With rebates and bundles you can get it at a low price, but as always with mail-in rebates, you have to keep copies and records in case it is not received or lost in the mail.</td><td>01 4, 2006</td><td>AYNAH993VDECT</td><td>bsg2004</td><td>null</td><td>Bloatware at its best; Resource hog especially with older computers</td><td>1136332800</td><td>false</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>B0002UCSKI</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Four computers connected via wireless to the internet.\n\nFirewall and antivirus haven't let me down yet, used them for several years, easy install and options.</td><td>10 9, 2005</td><td>A5X444UZBWXW2</td><td>RM GRAPHICS</td><td>null</td><td>Long time user</td><td>1128816000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0002UCSKI</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>I purchased this product primarily due to the low cost post mail-in rebates.

They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging.

It seemed that (as far as I could gather from other sources on the Internet) there was a Live Update that slowed my Internet browsing capability to a crawl.

Faxes, marked \"attention manager,\" to the customer service department also were ignored.\n\nFortunately for Symantec, the problem was finally resolved itself three or four weeks later with another Live Update (after wasting dozens of hours of my time) but I forwarded some of the correspondence to the Investor Relations department, with the name of the recalcitrant customer service representative, telling Symantec exactly why I will never buy anything from it in the future.</td><td>03 20, 2005</td><td>A25PSIGEGEL7DE</td><td>William A.

One feature I really like is banner blocking--it just removes those annoying flashing banners that you see on most sites (ex. \"You're the 1,000,000th visitor and you won a free DVD player!

I really liked the 2004 version and have had no major problems with it other than once my computer boots, I always had to go into NIS properties to see if my EMAIL SCANNING said 'ON' or 'ERROR'.  Evidently, something on my computer will occassionally cause the email scanning to not load properly, so if it showed 'ERROR' - I would have to reboot and then it would be ok.  I should point out that Norton Support Staff told me even though email scanning said 'error', the computer is still protected by the 'auto-protect' feature if it is turned on.  Minor inconvenience, but other than that, I was very happy with the program.\n\nThe same holds true for the new 2005 - I still have the occassional email scanning 'error', but there are a few new  irritating things happening.  While the software works fine, it has tremendously SLOWED DOWN the launch of Outlook Express and it even hangs a second or two when I close it.  Also, if you open NIS properties screen, when I am finished, I hit the X button to close, but it takes like 2-3 seconds before it will close.  Even though these are just a few seconds, it really irritates me because I have a very fast computer.\n\nHowever, something that really excites me about this new NIS is that the hard drive scan of all files by Norton Anti-Virus seems to take a lot less time than it did with a previous version.  Being a stickler for speedy computer processing, this is definitely a plus.\n\nSo, overall, this program works OK and keeps me protected, but I still think there are minor issues they need to work on as mentioned and I also think that the average computer user is not given enough information about whether to allow certain things when a firewall warning appears.  I know so many people that have blocked innocent programs and found that they are unable to use them or get on the internet.  There should be a way for NIS to know what is innocent and what should be blocked... the average computer user doesn't have the time to research what they should block or not - in fact, isn't that the reason we use computers?

It requires activation, but that's the least of its sins.  Scanning is slow, and it misses lots of trojans and worms.

More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldn't call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.\n\nLike I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.\n\nCHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.\n\nSETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.\n\nPUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5\n\nENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 4.5\nSetting: 4.5\nPuzzles: 4\nChallenge: 4.5\nEnding: 4\n= 26.5, divided by 6 = 4.41 rounded to 4 stars</td><td>06 18, 2015</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Puzzles Galore</td><td>1434585600</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Kept me interested throughout the game.</td><td>05 11, 2015</td><td>A19SRN7AX0VD9X</td><td>Faye N.

This lady detective heads on over to a 14th century English manor  reputed to hold a startling family history of intrigue, chaos, and scandal! Also, in recent events, a full-fledged curse involving a dangerous beast marauding the moors!  But to get down to business, she seeks why her neighbors' daughter is suffering from a strange case of [lycanthropy?}\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 93\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nLinda Penvellyn : I love a mysterious woman, but this is ridiculous! I really don't get the anger issues now that the plot reveal indicates the TRUE source of her ailments.  Was this just a woman who cannot handle stress or does she have other deep-seeded issues?\nI still have no idea what she looks like and I am not buying the game cover art because she was not involved in any real part of the storyline.\n\nJane Penvellyn : I really loved playing those games with her and I spanked her more times than not.  I sensed a little attitude with her at the end. I didn't know how to take that...\n\nMrs. Drake: I thought I would see more of her than I did especially since she was a main presence in the day-to-day events of the manor.  Then again, I never really enjoyed talking to her so I guess it was for the best.\n\nNigel Mookerjee:  A writer that was hired by Mrs. Drake to finally throw an encompassing tell-all [in a positive light] book revealing the exploits of the Penvellyn name.  I thought he was okay in general, but the typing test he had me perform was idiotic.\n\nEthel Bosinny: I really wanted to learn more about her and the fact that she startled me a couple time was really laughable. I probably never jumped in a ND game before, but they GOT me! :)  I wanted to learn more about what rituals/customs she was intent on passing down through the family lineage with Jane.\n\nNed Nickerson : Supportive as always.\n\nLoulou: A parrot that really DID get on your nerves after awhile. The voice was poorly-acted [sounding like a human mimicking a parrot] by whatever actor was in charge of that performance.  Also, if you were going to add catch-phrases, try adding at least TEN more. \"We are going to need a bigger boat.\" only goes so far after the 12th time heard.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 4 = 89\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nOne of the best scores I have heard in a ND game to date! Very enticing and it got you into the spirit of the adventure. Graphics, although not top-notch as the others, had designers working 24/7 because the immensity of what they had to  accomplish. So many areas of the manor were majestically done!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 4 = 93\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  I agree with past reviewers that there was a certain level of puzzle-solving that made it too hard for the casual gamer.  Mindlessly strutting around looking for leads would have added an extra five hours to my gameplay NEEDLESSLY, if I didn't short-cut with a walkthrough [didn't cheat the actual puzzles mind you]. I think they were too difficult for their own good and am trying very hard to remember if I actually enjoyed any of them.  The only thing that comes to mind is Skull & Bones and how Jane would ask \" Do you have any SPY-dehs??\" in her english accent. :) Go Dig!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 94\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: Now I don't mind not getting the culprit right, but when the set-up doesn't equal the payoff, I can get pretty upset. Why was I bothered to learn about this family in a historical sense? Okay, I forgive that, but here is what is NOT forgivable....absolutely no character  resolutions for the player.\n1) What was that wolf thing in the bushes? Was it real? If not, explain how it was faked! Same poor excuse like in SAWE\n2) Could Linda's ailments actually happen according to the explanation? No!\n3) What became of Linda except \"the family [Hugh/Linda/Jane] learned to grow together\". I want instant reactions to what happened immediately when the culprit was revealed...not a flimsy gloss-over going forward.\n4) No TRUE culprit punishment after all I invested? [13 game hours]\n5) What happened to all the side characters and their finality?\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 10 = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days  and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 56\n\nMy Strong Points: I battled to stay interested to the history of the family and even  memorized their family tree! [Where did that ultimately get me? 97% useless knowledge]  I solved the difficult games, but lets face it,  I am not spending four hours monkeying around with moving walls again and again. Why did I have to CONSTANTLY maneuver the gargoyle & dragon to enter the West & East secret rooms? Couldn't the developers put it as RESOLVED instead of the tediousness of doing the steps ten times throughout the game? I punished myself nonetheless, but especially because I had the culprit all wrong.\n\nMy Weak Points: General frustration with the game interface and it clouded my judgements on the linear tasks ahead.\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 56/ 2 = 70 [ C - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I'll not begrudge HER on how they wanted to resolve the main plotline, but for God Sakes clean up the ending so the Nancy Drew fans have some resolution on the other fifteen things that were occuring. We have invested countless hours and I learned nothing of how certain tricks were done and why. Should I just accept \"Because the culprit enjoyed lying\"?\n\nThus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, BLACKMOOR ranks.....# 18\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5\n2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87\n3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5\n5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER * 84\n6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL * 83\n7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5\n8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78\n11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77\n13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76\n14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72\n15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5\n16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71\n17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5\n18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70\n19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5\n20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69\n21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68</td><td>07 20, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Blackmoor a BLACK EYE for the ND franchise</td><td>1405814400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I refused to use a walkthrough for this game. Absolutely refused. And players, I promise you don't need one. You just really have to put your noggins to work. Which I can understand why some people don't like that (who loves thinking? pah! -- I kid, I promise). I just really (REALLY) enjoy brain teasers and puzzles. I always have. My mother got me two huge books full of puzzles as a kid and I finished them within a month. That being said, if you like your games more straight forward, you probably won't enjoy this game as much. But that's ok too, there's a hints and tips forum on HerInteractive that you can check for assistance. And I promise, this game is worth completing.\n\nMy one complaint about it would be that I would have liked to have done more with two of the characters. One mostly just ignored you when you spoke to her (and I understand, she was very, very sick, but I wish we could have had more conversations with her) and the other only appeared a few times and you were never able to seek her out. I would have loved to have been able to speak to her.\n\nBut really, they're minor complaints. This game is rich in history, both fictional and some real, the spooky air is well maintained, and the mystery goes perfectly with the adventure. I felt a bit intrusive on the family, but that's a good thing. It makes Nancy as a character stronger. She is nosy to a fault. And I thank the creator for that because that creates amazing games.\n\nIf you're ready to take a challenge and be scared a bit, then you're ready for this game. But if you're looking for something a bit easier to complete, I suggest picking up Treasure in a Royal Tower instead. It isn't scary by any means, but other than that it has a lot of the same things this game does. Rich history and a lot of exploring. If you're looking for an easier scary game...well, they haven't actually produced an easy scary game yet (and I don't think Haunted Mansion/Ghost Dogs count as scary, Malloy is a meh game and I don't recommend it to anyone, and Shadow at Water's Edge, while being pretty scary, is also a bit on the hard side).</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>I love a challenge.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Having played almost every game in the Nancy Drew PC series (missing SAW and FIN), I know that each game has a certain atmosphere in it; Some are more dark and murky (Castle Malloy comes to mind), some are very light and whimsical while still being a mystery (Secret of the Old Clock?), and some have a nicely balanced mixture of the two (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is a good example). Although I usually like the dark ones the least, something about this game was very gravitational. When I first started it, little did I know that not only I'd actually like it even a little, but I'd write a somewhat decent review on it.\n\nStory: 7.5/10. Orginially, Nancy shows up at Blackmoor Manor, a massive mansion in England, to find out what is wrong with newlywed Linda Penvellyn, who won't show her face or communicate with anyone, with the exception of a few words. Upon Nancy's arrival, weird things start happening fast, and it's clear that there's either a supernatual being in the residency, or someone really doesn't want Nancy there. The Penvellyn family is HUGE, and it was considerably fascinating to uncover more and more history.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 7.5/10. The characters are still robotic at this point in the series, but they're slowly improving. Since you stay indoors the whole time (which was a negative aspect for me), you got to really see the detail in the mansion, but boy is there a lot. The manor makes you feel very small, and it's full of a lot of surprises and secrets waiting to be uncovered.\n\nCharacters: 7/10. The characters were considerably good this time around. To name a few, there's the intentionally nice but slightly irritating girl Jane, the hired author, Nigel who's writing a Penvellyn memoir, and Mrs. Drake, a strict and uptight lady. There's also Loulou the parrot, who's helpful and funny, but annoying at times.\n\nPuzzles: 7/10. Even though I had to use a walkthrough for almost all of the puzzles, they still took a long time to get done. They really got you to think, but to the point where you're cranium hurt! I think this game sort of over-did the puzzles because they're soooo many. This isn't called the hardest Nancy Drew game for nothing.\n\nActivities: 5/10. There isn't anything really to do outside of the story progression, which I found very dissapointing. I realize that the point of these games is to sleuth and solve mysteries, but fun activities are a priority in my book, and this game just didn't have any.\n\nEnding: 7/10. Maybe the most simple ending yet in the series. Somewhat surprising as well.\n\nTotal: 7.33, rounded to the final score of....\n\n7.5/10.\n\nWhile I may be a tad biased because I don't usually enjoy the darker games, this game does deserve a purchase for many Nancy Drew PC fans, but I'd go with something else for now.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Curse of Blackmoor Manor review.</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" is probably one of the most revolutionary games in the Nancy Drew series. First of all, this is the first Nancy Drew game to take place somewhere outside of the continental United States, which deserves recognition in and of itself (yes - Nancy's FINALLY going out of the country to solve a case!). Secondly, Nancy's suspect list has always before been equally populated by men and women, or has had two or three men to one woman. For the first time, Nancy has a case with mostly female suspects (three females and one male). I found this very interesting, and nicely thought through. Thirdly, this is one of the most challenging and frightening Nancy Drew titles, and was advertised as the most so when it was released.\n\nNot only is the game revolutionary, but it's also awesome. The storyline is very intense, and the history surrounding Blackmoor Manor is so richly detailed. It's amazing to see how much thought must've gone into this game, and I imagine it took more effort from the creators than ever before.\n\nA young woman named Linda has recently married Hugh Penvellyn, a wealthy British diplomat, and has gone over to start a new life with him and his stepdaughter in England. They live together in Blackmoor Manor, where the Penvellyns have lived for hundreds of years. However, shortly after she moves in, Linda begins to feel sickly and starts behaving bizarrely. She throws fits, hides behind a bed curtain all day, and refuses to eat healthy food. Nobody knows what's caused this change in her, and in a fit of desperation, her mom (who still lives in America) calls Nancy to ask her if she could fly out to England to find out what's happening to Linda.\n\nOnce she arrives in Blackmoor Manor, Nancy hears a sinister-sounding creature call out her name. When she looks around, she sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at her. Mrs. Drake, an elderly woman who's been taking care of the manor, answers the door, but not before the creature leaves. Mrs. Drake seems skeptical of what Nancy claims to have seen, but that doesn't stop Nancy from investigating. She soon discovers that one of the Penvellyns to own Blackmoor Manor was burned at the stake for witchcraft hundreds of years ago, and a beast she's rumored to have created had been prowling the moors for years. Could this beast have now returned? And why? And what (if anything) does it have to do with Linda? The answers to all these questions and more can only be found by solving this case...\n\nThis is probably one of the most unique plots in the Nancy Drew series.  This is the first time when she's not called in to investigate high-profile crimes, like murder, threats, vandalism, kidnapping, theft, and the like. \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" is also the first game to feature a family struggle that's turned into a mystery that Nancy is now called to solve. I enjoyed this plot quite a bit, and felt it was quite refreshing.\n\nBlackmoor Manor is beautifully detailed. The graphics used in this game are superb, and even though it was released way back in 2005, the gaming quality and graphics still rival many games today. I really can't complain about the graphics, save for the fact that Jane's appearance might seem a tiny bit disproportional (but she's also young, short, and sitting down on a bed, which is hard to animate).\n\nThis game featured A LOT of puzzles, but they were all very well-explained and served a purpose for being there. I liked them all, and even though others might complain, I personally cannot. I also liked exploring the manor, which is rather large and has many places and things to see. My sole complaint is that at least half of the exploration takes place in the secret passageways, and I would've liked to see more of the \"outer surface\" of Blackmoor Manor.\n\nThere were also lots of fun mini games to play, so the player can find something else fun to do in the game if they're bored with solving puzzles and want to take a break from the mystery. The character Jane has several games that Nancy can play with her. All of them have to be played at least once to progress the game in some way, but they can all be played again as much as the player wants to (Jane's always up for play!).\n\nAll of the characters were very well-developed, and all had reason for being at the manor while Nancy was staying there. They also all had something to benefit by causing the haunting and horror surrounding Blackmoor Manor, and for terrorizing poor Linda. The first suspect met is Mrs. Drake, Hugh's aunt with a self-righteous attitude and believes the British to be superior to the Americans in every way. Nigel Mookerjee is a historian who's been hired by Mrs. Drake to write a book on the Penvellyns, and is looking for something in the family history to \"spice things up\" for his book. Jane Penvellyn is Hugh's 12-year-old daughter who's been forced to return to the manor after living in the United States for awhile, and seems to miss her biological mother very much. Ethel Bosinny is Jane's private tutor who only appears every so often, and is very elusive and mysterious in the sense that she never seems to be found in the same place twice (nor can when she'll appear be predicted).\n\nThe other characters and phone friends are all pretty nicely integrated too. I absolutely loved the fact that Nancy can call Ned again (as he hadn't appeared in a game since \"The Final Scene\"), and the new method of getting hints that this game employed was very unique and fun. Rather than getting her hints from her phone friends, Nancy consults with Loulou, an 80-year-old female parrot who's residing in the manor. Loulou is very smart, and has quite a lot of funny comments to make about the case and everything involved. She's very well-scripted, and I loved talking to her because of how much comedic relief she added to the game.\n\nAll and all, the characters were great. I honestly didn't know who the culprit would be for sure until the end, but I did have my greatest suspicion leaning toward one particular person. This hunch was correct, but I was glad about that, as it employed two moves that needed to be done in culprit selection (one that'd never been done before, and one that was rarely done before). I won't say anything further, as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played...\n\n\"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" had a great musical score. I liked the traditional British feel of the music, and it definitely suited the location of the mystery. Every now and then, it also got more eerie, which also added to the overall fright factor.\n\nAfter being voted into the top three overall games, \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" was released in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites pack with \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" and \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\". Did it earn its spot there? For sure! This game brought a true revolution to the Nancy Drew games, and remains one of the best even to this date. I've been playing this game for years, and I still jump a bit whenever I see phantoms and monsters creeping about the manor, watch clips of nightmares that Nancy has, or Ethel pops up in the middle of the night. It's a fun fright that's perfect for those who're willing to face their fears and solve one of the most terrifying cases that adventure gaming has ever known!</td><td>07 13, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Only the Fearless Dare Walk These Halls...</td><td>1310515200</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>In my humble opinion this is probably the best Nancy Drew game of the series.  This game finds Nancy in a creepy mansion in England attempting to find out why an old friend appears to be under a curse.  Her adventures take her all over the mansion, which is clearly hiding some secrets.  The mansion is delightfully spooky, and there are plenty of spooky happenings to add to the atmosphere.  This game has some of the most challenging puzzles of all the Nancy Drew games.  It's also quite long.

Seriously, it was so much fun, and I was constantly getting chills from the scary storyline.  I was really needing this game as before this game HERinteractive wasn't really doing too great with their games.\n\nStory-Your neighbor has asked you to go to England to check on her daughter, Linda.  Linda has suddenly started hiding behind a curtain in her bedroom and refused to let anyone see her.  She has also started to have temper tantrums, which according to her mother are totally unlike her.  You soon realize that something supernatural may be behind this sudden change in behavior.\n\nGraphics-Okay, so these didn't get too much better, but they are still good.  All the spooky areas are dark, while the mansion is always lit up, and I did find the artwork rather well done.\n\nSound-The voice acting was very good in my opinion as was the music.  There are lots of songs in this game, I thought, and I liked them all.\n\nGameplay-Everything is the same except you don't leave the manor ever and the puzzles are HARD.  This was the first game where I found there were tons of puzzles and they were challenging without being frustrating.  Whenever you get stuck you can ask a parrot for hints, but you cannot call Bess and George in this game although you can call Ned.\n\nFun-This game is so fun, and it is really scary, too.  I just want to mention that some people will not want to play this game because it does talk of witches, werewolves, alchemy, and rituals.  I didn't find it satanic or anything, but I think some people will want to skip this game if they don't like things like that.\n\nLength-I must have played this 1 or 2 months!  It was so fun!  And, still, when I replay it, it takes me 12-15 hours to finish.  It is really long, and I loved that!\n\nThis is the perfect PC game that I recommend to everyone except those who are concerned about the above mentioned.

The woman has apparently become sick shortly after her new marriage. Rumors abound that the Beast of Blackmoor is creeping around, along with a family witch.\n\nSuspects include Linda's stepdaughter Jane Penvellyn, scholar Nigel Mookerjee, batty old Mrs. Drake, and Jane's tutor Ethel Bosinny.\n\nThe villain and the Penvellyn treasure were both RIDICULOUS. All that threatening atmosphere and chilling spookiness wasted on such silly things.\n\nPuzzles: C\n\nArgh! Just aargh! So many of them! And so tedious they were! The premise is that the Penvellyn family has a long and illustrious history of being geniuses of one kind or another. Each member of the family studied a certain subject, such as computers or astronomy. And they all left clues for future generations to a great hidden treasure (there it is again). The clues are all crazily scattered all over the manor, hidden in Latin crests and books and alchemical symbols.\n\nYou also have to talk to an 80-year-old parrot to solve one puzzle. The family trusted a huge and important secret partly to a parrot that could keel over at any moment. (Yes, they live a long time, but not every parrot lives so long.)\n\nOther silly details include a revolving room and a strange map that somehow tracks your progress through an area, even though GPS wasn't invented way back when.\n\nThey could have left out the anacronistic map, sure, but then we would have been in serious trouble. The gamers needed all the help they could get in this game. The puzles just kept going and going. The game was long and involved.\n\nGameplay: C\n\nNancy is supposedly in England and we aren't allowed to see a single bit of the English countryside. Why? Because Mrs. Drake doesn't want us tracking mud through the house. If I came a thousand miles to another country, nobody would stop me from taking a look outside! This game didn't even have to be set in England. It could have taken place in Salem, Mass. just as easily. (Of course, the Penvellyn family wouldn't have been as old then.)\n\nI couldn't trigger some events in the game no matter how carefully I played or what walkthrough I followed. I ended up downloading saved games from other people to get past these parts of the game. It lessened the quality of the gameplay for me, to say the least.\n\nOne thing I loved were Jane's mini-games. Sometimes I open the game just to play Skull and Bones.\n\nTime Changes: The alarm clock is back. Argh!\n\nVoice Acting: B\n\nJane is a cute, cultured little English girl. Ethel got on my nerves, appearing out of nowhere and looking down her nose at me. Linda irritated me, her voice and character. I mean, I realize you're depressed, but I flew a thousand miles to help you, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just answer my questions instead of clamming up, okay, lady?\n\nThe cockney rhyming slang was extra cool, though.\n\nMusic: A\n\nVery restrained and classical. Chilling and spooky when it needed to be.\n\nIGraphics/Video: A\n\nJane in particular was weirdly animated. All joints and long legs. I think she was too thin.\n\nOther than that, the graphics were the best yet. Bonus points for the smooth animated sequences in between player-controlled action.\n\nTechnical: C\n\nAlong with the problem I had triggering events, I had another glitch in the game. When ordering food from the restaurant, it would appear on a silver platter in my room. But, after that, I could never get other food to be delivered, no matter how long I waited or how many times I asked for it. Every time I lifted the lid, it would always be the first thing I had ordered.\n\nOverall, it was a good game, but it's definitely not my favorite.</td><td>04 2, 2007</td><td>A2PXVOXNYAPPU6</td><td>Bethany L.

The puzzles are hard and you are obliged to play several games with the little girl in the story, Jane, in order to obtain certain tools to proceed. These games within the game did get a bit tedious, but I am was hopelessly slow at \"Petroglyph Punch\" and the like. And it took me five tries to gather up 13 ghosts milling around the manor. When something is timed I panic. I'm like my cats who vanish if I even look at the door where the vacuum cleaner is kept.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, and if the British accents aren't authentic, so what. The images of the characters are very well done, the gestures and mouth synchronization very natural. Mrs. Drake is particularly good, she's rather like a watered down version of Mrs. Danvers.\n\nI could not have finished this game without the help of a walkthrough. The puzzles are hard.

Since the 2003 version I have noticed a significant slowing of my computing but have been unable to identify the source.\n\nI ran four different anti-spyware programs, I \"cleansed\" the system using all of Norton's utilities and still my computer was painfully slow hanging up on startup and shutdown. I even ran Hijack This and scrupulously followed the tutorial on MajorGeeks. My problems grew progressively worse until I read somewhere that Norton might well be causing my problems.\n\nAt first I discounted this possibility out of hand - I mean, after all, this was a premier program that had been around for years! Their new CEO is touted as the second coming by all of the business magazines and newspapers. Surely, IT couldn't be the source of my problems. But out of frustration I took Norton off of my computer and VOIL my problems went away! I couldn't believe it. No more computer crashes, no more slovenly performance, no more hanging up on shutdown and interminable startup times.\n\nI was then confronted with finding another program to supplant Norton. I searched Cnet and came up with PC-Cillin! This program works great. I does not degrade performance one iota! No hanging up on shutdown or interminable startup times. This program works silently in the background and is literally updated daily in 3 - 5 seconds. I couldn't possibly be more pleased.\n\nThe firewall in this program seems to work OK - I am unable to appreciate a significant difference from my free version of Zone Alarm.  Spam control implementation is very clumsy, as are most other programs, and it would seem it will be awhile until we get a seamless elegant spam control solution, at least from Trend Micro.  Spyware is certainly no better than Ad-aware.\n\nFor the life of me I cannot understand how a company as distinguished as Symantec could fritter away all their goodwill and reputation by putting out a program that is quite simply awful.

That's a plus right out of the starting gate.\n\nI originally switched to Trend from Norton after having slowdowns and resource shortages. Norton is very large and very slow, but by and large it worked for me. I was hesitant to make the switch, but I decided to do it anyway and see how Trend's product works. I have not been disappointed. First off, the memory footprint for this package is about half that of Norton when everything is turned on. For me, that's important - Norton takes up huge amounts of memory and slows the system down, where Trend takes up less room and seems to be a lot faster at execution time.\n\nTrend has always had a very fast and very effective antivirus. This latest version is no exception. However, where this package seems to shine most brightly in the antivirus arena is in the timeliness of pattern file updates. Less than a week after the release of a particular email virus, Trend caught it arriving in my inbox and terminated it before it could do anything. To have a pattern for a brand new virus and already be able to handle it is a very, very good thing.\n\nThe firewall itself is quite effective and it seems to do its job very efficiently. Where it tends to bother people is in the fact that it is a very quiet firewall and it does not notify for every little thing like Norton or ZoneLabs do. This may or may not agree with you, but for me I'm content that it's working in the background and isn't bothering me with every little thing that happens.\n\nThe spyware detection feature seems to have come of age, and even after running SpyBot S&D and Ad-Aware, it still found spyware on my system. It did a good job cleaning up and it did everything very fast and efficiently.\n\nThere are a couple of things I cannot test, as I am on dialup. There are new network protection features that allow remote security administration for systems on the network running Trend's suite, and there is also a neat feature that loooks for intruders on wireless networks. Considering that cybersquatting on wireless networks is very common, this is an important feature that should be in all security suites. If you are running a wireless network, this feature will be invaluable.\n\nTrend includes a parental control feature in its suite, and it works in a fashion similar to Norton's and ZoneLab's equivalents. You pick your categories to block, and you're done. However, there is a flaw in their implementation - the blocking only seems to work with MS Internet Explorer. So, if you use Mozilla/FireFox or Opera, you're out of luck if you want to use the URL blocking.\n\nThere is also an antispam feature, but it is not going to prevent spam from arriving in your inbox. Rather, it simply flags questionable messages as spam in the subject at delivery. This can help with sorting and disposal, but it will not keep it from being delivered. In my opinion, spam should never reach the email client if you have an antispam solution in place, so I regard this particular feature as ineffective. I suppose it is better than nothing, though, and many users will find it helpful - I don't. I didn't like Norton's, either, which works the same way.\n\nOne interesting feature that Trend sports is \"Outbreak Notification\" which is used to alert users when a new, high-risk threat is circulating. Users will get a notification when a new high-profile virus is spreading, and that can be helpful if you're relying on manual updates.\n\nTrend Micro has put together a winner in their 2005 edition of their PC-Cillin Internet Security suite. It does not lack any major features, and the majority of the things they have included are very good and very effective.

For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.\n\nIt's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)\n\nAs I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.</td><td>10 20, 2010</td><td>A38NELQT98S4H8</td><td>WB Halper</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5</td><td>1287532800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed.

Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on \"the best way to lay out a site using CSS\" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.\n\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.\n\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\n\nUI - at the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.</td><td>10 18, 2010</td><td>A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</td><td>Grimmy</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A good value</td><td>1287360000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is \"Certified Associate,\" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\n\nWith this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from \"Adobe Certified Instructors\", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.\n\nFor the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a \"test\" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\n\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I've simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you'll be learning on the videos.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n1) HTML Refresher - This is an excellent section for someone who already knows HTML, but could use a refresher in the form of a \"crash course.\"  You'll find a URL overview, an HTML intro (tags, how some browsers read tags differently, and what Dreamweaver \"does behind the scenes).\n\n2) Dreamweaver Introduction - You'll finally be able to learn what WYSIWYG is, you'll be introduced to Dreamweaver Design, Code, and split screens, and the welcome screen.

This was a long review, but hopefully anyone looking for core training in web communication will now know exactly what they will receive when they purchase this program.</td><td>10 16, 2010</td><td>ACJT8MUC0LRF0</td><td>D.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.\n\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\n\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\n\n  What this is\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\n  - A great overview of using DW\n\nWhat it isn't\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.</td><td>10 12, 2010</td><td>AYUF7YETYOLNX</td><td>Bryan Newman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A Fantastic Overview of Dream Weaver and Web Design in General</td><td>1286841600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I decided (after trying a number of other products) to switch to the gold standard of web site management, Dreamweaver.

Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.\n\nThe opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\n\nI'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.\nAt some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version.

Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.\n\nThere are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.\n\nAll in all, this is a great product for the price.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A2WCFDOCS73PNB</td><td>Gadgetman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Excellent value for the price</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Even though I use Dreamweaver a great deal and own several books on the subject, I found this set very helpful. Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.\n\nThe videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (\"Fireworks\" for \"Firefox,\" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.\n\nSince each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the \"Watch and work\" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.\n\nNew features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.\n\nIf you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.</td><td>10 28,

Of course, there will always be some things that can be done without, like having to select a new page, or blank workbook from among templates every time the program is opened, or the cutesy graphics around the borders of the applications.\n\nOffice is still a five star product in my book.

That being said, from the perspective of a layperson, this version of Trend Micro's security software appears to be doing a sufficient job protecting me and my computer from our respective selves. The first point to mention is that setup is extremely user friendly, even with regard to some of the specific software settings. At this point I have probably meddled with the configurations as much as I ever will, as I have only utilized this product on my home PC. Nonetheless, I have taken further steps customizing my security settings than I have ever done previously simply because of this software's ease of use and thorough, yet simple, explanation of available functions. One such customization option that I have now utilized for the first time on any security software is the parental control/web browser settings. The ability to restrict specific categories of information, images, and data, as well as descriptions of each category, allows one to feel confident in what they are blocking and what they are allowing on a user specific basis.\n\nBeyond the actual customizable functions, almost everyone probably has the same question: will this security software slow everything on my computer to a screeching halt? After a little use, it seems that this particular software has not had the same ridiculous stopping power of other security platforms that I have utilized in the past. That is, as of this moment, I am pleased with my ability to utilize this software as the issuing company recommends while continuing the use of any other applications simultaneously. All in all, I am not disappointed and, perhaps, pleased (if such a thing is possible when dealing with PC/Internet security software).</td><td>11 11, 2008</td><td>A17A1KTVI3DG6U</td><td>Nathan A.

I knew I wanted something else and understood that I would likely have to forfeit something to reclaim my computer's resources.\n\nAccording to the pros, Trend Micro's Max Security is great at preventing new threats, but it is completely inept at detecting old threats. This necessitates an initial malware scan with something other than the provided software; perhaps a free download. This, as far as I can gather, is the greatest drawback to this software. However, I am personally willing to take the extra step to pre-scan my computer, for the sake of optimizing my computer's speed. The interface on Trend Micro is also extremely user friendly.\n\nAn ideal situation would be something between the security of BitDefender and the speed of Trend Micro.

While the photo focused features are probably only a step or two beyond the software that is included with many digital cameras today, or can be downloaded for free, the video tools justify the cost.\n\nThe software is neat; however, it is by no means professional grade. The features are extremely limited and basic compared to the pro-grade tools - but this software does not claim to be a professional suite, and the price reflects this point. Honestly, with the shopping cart almost always looming in the corner of the screen, I feel as if this software has been designed, in large part, to direct aftermarket sales to its affiliate.

The fact is, almost every other program I tried annihilated my computer's performance in comparison to Trend's light load. What's more, because of the rather typical use of my machine, Trend seems to do just as good of a job protecting my PC as the big gun programs that bring it to a grinding halt.\n\nAll in all, I don't seem to require more security than what Trend provides, and I definitely require more performance out of my computer than what many other programs permit.

I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.\n\nThe problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.\n\nLow and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.\n\nI told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning. My uncle called me yesterday. He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton. He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing. He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.\n\nI've replaced Norton System Works with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded.\n\nIf you are having unexplained problems with your computer that your anti-virus program and spyware programs are not solving and if you have this bloated pig of a program on your computer then you need to delete it.\n\nNorton has been getting these reports on their software for over three years and refuses to correct the problem.

BitDefender Total Security 2009 so far has been great for me.  It got rid of viruses that infected one of our computers while it ran McAfee, which I decided to try since it is free from my internet provider.  I tried to clean my computer with McAfee and TrendMicro before I purchased a copy BitDefender 2009 (the virus blocked access to all security web sites so I could not try free copies).  I purchased the copy based on my previous year's experience, where I used a free copy of BitDefender 2008 to clean up my child's computer so that I could install TrendMicro 2008.  I had already paid for TrendMicro 2008, but it could not clean up the computer enough for successful installation.\n\nSecondly, any security software can cause problems.  My employer only buys certain computers and does extensive testing before allowing any software on a computer.  An individual can do that, but its lots of work.  Or an individual can try free evaluations of security software and find one that works.  All security software companies offer free evaluation copies for 15 to 30 days.  Try what you want before purchasing\n\nThirdly, the problem with update KB954430 is not caused by BitDefender per se (as stated by one reviewer), or is a problem with all security software.  I developed that problem while using McAfee.  Microsoft says the cause is \"Different versions of MSXML are included with various Microsoft products, such as Windows, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft SQL Server, and some third-party products.\"  [...] which also has an abbreviated solution and a link to a detailed solution)  Granted, this may be \"third party products.\" I found one reference directly blaming BitDefender while I found many sites blaming Norton.\n\nLast, people need to have reasonable expectations.  I have only seen high quality customer support once on software that costs less than [...] . I contacted BitDefender (which is under $100) once and got a very technical \"solution\" for a problem that was not even their fault.  For something this inexpensive  that is all I can ask.  I do not expect them to hold my hand.\n\nI feel BitDefender 2009 is the best software to try first since it offers great protection for a great price and relative to other software, except Kapersky, has the best chance of working on your computer.</td><td>01 1, 2009</td><td>A2QQEURPB1VQF7</td><td>A.

AVG's \"Anti-Virus & Anti-Spyware\" is basically a step up from the freeware that I have been using for several years on one of my PCs. The two year subscription is a big plus, hopefully it will keep me worry free.\n\nThe program installed without issue once I put the disc in my drive, entered the license information and waited about five minutes for the process to finish. I rebooted my machine, registered my copy and everything appeared to be working fine. The program updated the virus and spyware definitions to the latest available versions, then the program said that there was a newer version of the program available for download. Apparently the disc has version 8. X on it, and there is version 9. X out on the upgrade server. That's great, but why didn't it tell me that before I wasted my time installing from the disc? This is one thing that Kaspersky informs you of, and seems like a logical place to have up front. So I downloaded the newest version, which seemed to take a long time. I don't remember how many megabytes it was but I don't think it was a big file, yet took awhile to acquire.\n\nOnce the upgraded version of AVG's Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware was installed, I rebooted the computer only to find that the Anti Virus engine failed to initialize. Windows Security Center informed me that the anti virus software was turned off, and when I opened the AVG control panel it was confirmed. The antivirus component, as well as several other components were not active. I decided another reboot was in order, but when the computer came back up it was the same scenario, it was still not active. No matter how many times I rebooted the machine I could not get the modules to get to their active state so I figured something must have gone wrong during the install. I decided to uninstall the software and try again, hoping that this time it will load properly.\n\nIt took two attempts after the initial install of the upgraded version of AVG Anti Virus & Anti Spyware and about two hours to be successful. Finally the program loaded with active components and theoretically was doing its thing. That's where this review gets difficult as far as the functionality of this software, since unless you get hit by a virus or spyware you don't really know if the program is working OR if the virus or spyware is not detected by the software you don't know that it has failed.\n\nAs far as the user interface on AVG's Antivirus & Antispyware, it is similar to other programs, showing each component and its status, then getting more detailed if you click on the icon. It contains the following: Antivirus, Antispyware, LinkScanner, Anti Rootkit, Email Scanner, Web Shield, Resident Shield, Update Manager, and License. What you do not get in this version of the software is a Firewall and Identification Protection. For that you will have to get the Internet Security product. Off to the left side of the interface there is the computer scanner button, which allows you to manually scan your whole computer, scan specific files or folders, and an anti rootkit scan. You can also manage scheduled scans, allowing you to plan when you want scans to occur (assuming you leave your computer on during those times).\n\nSo far, the software has not indicated that I have had any threats to my system since it has been installed. Like I mentioned early that could be a good thing or a bad thing. Subsequent scans have also indicated that the computer is clean. I am hoping that AVG's Anti-Virus & Anti Spyware is doing its job since you really don't know it's there except for the icon in the system tray, when it is performing an update, when it scans an email you are sending or receiving, or it lets you know you are visiting a safe website. It does not noticeably slow your computer down, but you know it is running in the background and you hope it catches a threat before it is too late. I just hope it never has to.\n\nI am giving it three stars because of the initial install issues, not because of the performance or user interface.</td><td>01 1, 2010</td><td>A4U27URFECK1U</td><td>The Technologist</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>I had a little trouble after the update, but now it's working!</td><td>1262304000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0039L6G00</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>Microsoft Word 2010 builds on an idea that Microsoft is famous for, which is to refine the dashboard of the car, not the engine or performance of the car, building on an already successful overload of bloated and reckless programming. I can't 100% vouch for this, because I don't work for Microsoft, but this program is yet another example of where Microsoft completely depends on the fact that many businesses and end users are ONLY familiar with Word, and little else. Had this not been the case, Microsoft Word would be an incredibly awful piece of over-priced, bloated, buggy software.\n\nStill chock full of inconsistencies and performance/reliability issues, it's possible that much of the talent behind this program is fresh meat or Microsoft didn't seem to put much effort into Design Verification testing. Other similar Word Processors seems to be less crash-prone in Windows than Microsoft's very own Word Processor. I will defend Word here, that the Auto-Save/recovery technology is pretty good....and necessary.\n\nNow, the more frustrating thing I find that this program does NOT do well, is to give the end user a way to move objects, pictures, boxes, and charts around the page without utterly and completely destroying certain aspects of page formatting. There are some facets that Word can handle well, such as the realization that the end user wants each new line to continue with a number, bullet, Bold, etc. but outside of that, Word is pretty, well....dumb. It also seems Microsoft, as usual just makes it more complex and frustrating by changing where things are like a department store. This simply DOESN'T work for end users. Ever complain that your local grocer re-arranged the store, and now you have to spend twice as long re-orienting yourself with the layout, and having to ask for help twice as often?  Even the help isn't very intelligent or useful? Sound familiar? It is here.\n\nI will still use Word, because like I said, it's what I'm very familiar with, but I still curse at it often. I actually found it more enjoyable to take a week to learn Adobe's InDesign to accomplish much of what Word never could dream of doing on a page. Like some very prominent authors state they use Word for writing, they certainly don't use it for any type of finished product. Not that Word is expected to be a full-on publishing application, but with the price Microsoft puts on Word it should at least try and compete beyond the limits of freeware.\n\nConclusion: If you're only familiar with Word, and you are required to use it, or have many people you send/receive documents from that use Word, stick with it and you'll survive life. If not, give some other programs like OpenOffice a good whirl until Microsoft can at least work out their own internal incompatibilities and inconsistencies, while hopefully taking better control of their own pricing.</td><td>01 1, 2012</td><td>AITDAGXGMCSEZ</td><td>Brian M.

A feature I particularly appreciated was the ease of transferring copious investment data from Quicken to Turbotax, saving hundreds of hours of manual entry to satisfy the prying eyes of the gnomes of the IRS. But if you purchase TurboTax 2012, IT WILL NOT TRANSFER YOUR DATA FROM THE 2010 QUICKEN SOFTWARE - YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO 2013 QUICKEN IN ORDER TO TRANSFER YOUR FINANCIAL DATA FROM 2012 !!!\n\nThis kind of entrapment of customers - deception if you are feeling charitable, highway robbery if you are being realistic  - is totally unacceptable, reprehensible and borderline theft. My license to use 2010 Quicken was valid throughout 2012, yet Intuit won't allow me to transfer my data to Turbotax because the license expires in 2013 ???\n\nSo, having returned my first copy of Quicken 2013 to the store from whence it came, and denied a refund despite its admitted failure to function correctly, then accepting a 50% discount on another software purchase as my consolation . . . I have now been forced to purchase a second copy of Quicken 2013 from  Amazon so as not to develop hand cramps from transcribing data from Quicken 2010 into Turbotax 2013 !\n\nThis kind of maltreatment of customers is why I shall curse the days of birth of the Intuit developers and their demonic management, and then light candles to ask that their genes never be permitted to be passed on to another generation of thieves and scoundrels. I will also pray that one day soon a team of honest developers (in a software company that doesn't have as its top priority the ravaging of the customer base in order to increase the value of stock options for the top managers) writes a solid tandem of software products that blows Intuit out of the water - and blasts those Intuit developers and managers back into the fires of Hades from whence they seem to have come.\n\nThe software itself is brilliant, if a bit on the heavy side. The preparation of a straightforward tax return is simple, fast, effective and as far as I have been able to discern, totally accurate. It would rate 5 stars if it weren't for the scam I perceive as outlined above.\n\nUpdate 8 Jan 2013 - - - - -\n\nIf you have foreign accounts, beware! When transfers are made from Quicken 2013 (Q2013) of 2012 data entered in Q2010 and transferred into Q2013 because TurboTax 2012 (T2012) will not take data from Q2010 . . . Euros are not converted to Dollars when the transfer to Turbotax is made! My compensation is paid directly into an account in Europe denominated in Euros - but the transfer takes the total amount and calls it dollars. The interest on my bank account is kept as the same number, but shown as dollars, not Euros. Same for everything else I've checked so far. I don't think the IRS would be amused if I trusted Intuit's software. Neither should you.</td><td>01 1, 2013</td><td>A363RAQ1NTCXTW</td><td>jasonhad</td><td>List(null,  Software, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>CAUTION !!!

Once you figure out how to do it, then you realize how powerful the editor is.\n\nThis year I've created projects with Cyberlink PowerDirector and iMovie.  Not surprisingly, when you just want to quickly put together some clips to post to facebook, iMovie wins.  Next up, I like power director, but it is only slight ahead of Pinnacle Studio.\n\nOne really nice thing is that it has a lot of built in transitions and effects.  I found the export menu to be one of the easier menus I've used.\n\nI liked the clip editor screen quite a bit (after I youtubed a tutorial).  However, I used color and brightness correction on a snow video (sledding) and the final result didn't look very good.  It really struggled to properly correct the snow.\n\nOne thing I really didn't like is that the effects / transitions labeled \"GPU\" wouldn't preview render for me at all.  This is very annoying, especially since I have a Radeon r9 270x GPU.  I also pulled up the GPU monitor when doing export and as far as I could tell it never even used the GPU.

It graded the risk of each type as Low or Medium, I had no High risk infections.  It also gave a count of each type of infection and a description of what each one was.  I then had the option to pick and choose what I wanted cleaned off.  This was important because the software picked up one infection that was a legitimate application but that uses registry keys that some people find undesirable.  I cleaned off everything without setting a restore point.\nThe cleanup was very quick.\n\nCons:\n- None noted but the true measurement of software like this is how effective it is at getting everything that's on my PC.  I ran my virus software after Spyware Doctor to see if it would pick up anything else. After 20 minutes I shut it down, tired of waiting.

The ratings are all over the map.  Sometimes Trend Micro is listed in the top ten antivirus software programs and more often not.  It seems to depend on the methodology used to rate these programs, and of course on which set of rating one can trust.  But they all seem to agree that Trend Micro is great in threat detection.\n\nI've found that both the email and phone support for Trend Micro are great, and a good tutorial would also be useful.  What I like about the program is its ease of use and the fact that it doesn't do anything that I find annoying such as trying to insist on presence of a toolbar for example.  It's easy to forget about the program and just feel confident that it's working.  The automatic updates and scans are excellent.\n\nA big concern is whether one's antivirus program slows down the system.  Trend Micro doesn't slow me down more than anything else I've tried but I have never used one of the truly expensive antivirus programs that are touted as better in this regard.  My judgment is that Trend Micro is fast in its price category in which I am familiar.\n\nThis software does not offer everything.  It does not offer full Web protection or adequate protection against spam, a constant thorn in anyone's side.  It's not Virus Bulletin Certified 100% for Windows XP or Vista.

My initial reaction to Money 2004 was negative, but I got used to it over time. My new bank only provides downloads to Quicken, which makes sense given Money's extinction, forcing me to migrate back to Quicken. I can't say that I'm very impressed.\n\nThe interface is very clunky; I doubt it's improved at all in the five years I've been away. (Even Microsoft Money 2004 had a cleaner interface, and Microsoft undoubtedly improved on it over the years.) There are too many different levels of menus -- top-level, register-level, account-level, and more -- which makes use of the product confusing. The one thing I really appreciated about Quicken in the past is thankfully still there: when you balance an account, you have the option of deselecting all qualifying items and then reselecting them one at a time. (In Money 2004, you would have had to manually deselect all of the items.) This allows you to balance your account by ticking off transactions one-by-one.\n\nThe product is for some reason dependent on Internet Explorer; when I wanted to register Quicken and when I wanted to download a program update, I had to make Internet Explorer my default browser (otherwise, it's Mozilla). This is annoying, and I don't recall any other non-Microsoft product having this restriction.\n\nI had difficulty setting up one of my banks for automatic download. This is definitely a result of the way that the bank's security is set up, but Quicken (the program; I haven't contacted technical support) has not been helpful in providing clues about how to resolve the problem. (It did provide an inconvenient workaround, but I would like the problem to be fixed.)\n\nI do not like the way that the program promotes fee-for-service programs like billpay that you can get through Quicken.com. This is only a minor annoyance, but it's built into the program.\n\nIn all, Quicken seems like it will do the job I need it to, but it's not elegant or fun. Unfortunately, it's the only game in town.\n\nNote that I have not used any of the features that distinguish Home & Business from its less expensive siblings, so I can't comment on them yet.</td><td>01 10, 2010</td><td>A3O0GVCFV59SZ5</td><td>Michael and Julie</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>A bit on the clunky side</td><td>1263081600</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0046ED0LW</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>In a few words: after trying out this product I was not persuaded that I actually needed it and I removed it from the computer on which it was installed. And here it is why.\n\n- As a Windows 7 user I am perfectly happy with Microsoft Security Essentials, a free product that does not expire and therefore does not spam me with renewal reminders that I need to renew my subscription soon. To my knowledge, MSE works on Vista as well but I'm not sure about the XP.\n- There is very little if anything that  AVG offers that is not available 'for free' from other sources. For example, Windows 7 and Vista already come with their own firewall. All Web browsers come with some built-in Phishing protection and most public email providers have near-perfect Spam filters. Another worthy feature that AVG provides - the ability to flag 'dangerous' sites is either supported by browsers natively or can be enabled with free extensions.\n- Some of the claims on the box (marketing) can be quite funny. For example, the writing on the back of the box states that AVG provides \"Hassle-free security that won't slow you down**\" But, when you go to the ** fine print it reads \"All security software uses memory and processor power and can therefore result in slower system performance.\" Another claim is that AVG 'keeps your information safe' while shopping and banking. I expect that the banks would dispute that banking is less safe absent AVG as for the overall safety of 'my information', the leaks usually originate from hackers or other agents attacking/accessing or demanding 'my information' from the banks and AVG can't protect me from that.\n\nConsidering the above, I see no reason why I should pay for features and services already provided for free by my computer's operating system, browsers or email providers AND go through the hassle of annual renewals and slow down my computer in the process. If AVG offers anything 'extra' when compared to whatever I get from MSE/Chrome/Gmail, it must be very little because I didn't notice it while AVG was installed. The 2 stars rating (means \"I don't like it\" and in this case \"I don't need it\") is justified because, in my view, paying for an AVG one-year license can't be justified.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nSPECS\n\nSystem requirements - minimum requirements with 'recommended' requirements within ()\n\n- Pentium 1.5 (1.8) GHz\n- RAM: 512 MB\n- HDD space: 390 (510) MB\n\nCompatible with:\n\n- MS Windows XP\n- MS Vista (32/64 bit)\n- MS Windows 7 (32/64 bit)</td><td>01 10, 2011</td><td>ADLVFFE4VBT8</td><td>Cthulhu</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>I don't need it</td><td>1294617600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00576JM6A</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>First off, this will NOT accept information from Quickens Essentials for Mac, the copy that Intuit has been using for the past couple years.\n\nSecond, it still will not accept downloaded information from my bank or brokerage and both are among the largest in the nation and they don't charge for downloads.\n\nSay what you will about Quicken Essentials but at least it accepts downloads (albeit through a back door method).</td><td>01 10, 2011</td><td>A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ</td><td>MagnumMan</td><td>List(null, null, null,  Mac Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Still of No Use to Me</td><td>1294617600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0044DE8KC</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Being a long time (17 years) user of Chief Architect Inc software, all versions I never tire of singing its praises.

I know it's fashionable to hate on Norton and they were making really awful products for a while.  Since a revamp around 2009 their software has become very lightweight and fast.  I wouldn't full scan while on the computer but it won't slow down the system as it monitors your files.\n\nOne caveat, though.  I find Norton is too permissive compared to other software.  To combat this I change a few settings so it prompts me whether to accept new or unfamiliar files.  There is just one MAJOR problem when doing this ...\n\nAs of the date of my review, there is no way to accept or deny Norton when it prompts you.  Let me be clear.  When Norton prompts you whether to accept new or unfamiliar program files, there is no button to click to either accept or deny the file.  They forgot to put the buttons in the prompt. (!) Since Norton freezes your computer while waiting for a response and protects itself against attacks like \"End Process\", the only way to get rid of the prompt is to restart the computer.  People who use the default settings probably won't notice this for a while.  People who want control over what Norton accepts and denies will find this program unusable.  I realize these are non-standard settings but it should not have gone out the door like this.\n\nI have tried to contact Norton about this issue but navigating support is like making your way through a maze.  The best I could do was fill out a feedback form.  I'm not optimistic they will see this complaint, much less fix the problem.  Support was one of the reasons I stayed with Norton but it has taken a nosedive lately.\n\nEdit 4/14: Attempted an upgrade twice and a complete uninstall/reinstall twice including completely deleting all of my user data.  Now the current version of NIS 2012 will either completely lock up my Internet connection or the program grinds to a halt at random times.  If I try to open Norton it will lock up and give me an error 8504,104 (which helps a lot).  Of course I can't end the process (access denied) so I must restart the computer to get my connection back.  Funny thing is Norton will provide a toll-free telephone number for you to call if it cannot access the Internet.  However, in spite of going through two levels of \"support\", including having them take control of my computer and call me back two hours late, they cannot figure out the problem.  I had no troubles with NIS 2011 on this same computer.

I know this is expensive, but Windows 7 makes your computer life easier compared to Windows 8, unless of course you love Windows 8-in which case I don't want to deny you your choice.\n\nI just know that I can have 7 computers all on one HomeGroup, have a Start menu that isn't a world unto itself, have a browser that isn't broken by a feature Microsoft intended to make up for the increasing Orwelliam aspects of Windows 8 but that websites don't want to work with because the ads that make the Internet free depend on that feature being unavailable or at worst ineffective.

Of course, since I was doing the clean install thing, I had to re-import my programs, files, and settings from other computers on my HomeGroup, but I have done all that and it went smooth as silk.\n\nUnlike with Windows 8, I do not feel like I wasted my money on any of my 7 copies of Windows 7, regardless of the limitations Home Premium may have compared to Professional or Ultimate. (Of course it helps when 3 PCs were upgraded using the Windows 7 Family Pack, but that is something else entirely.\n\nAs to the disappointment some people voiced in libraries versus a concrete storage location, I think that you should have the libraries but have all the folders in a library be physically anchored within the library structure so that files are not being copied from mysterious library locations but instead are being copied from whatever physical folder is the part of the library from which the file you eant to copy to the destination PC is located in.\n\nUpdate 2-3-2014:\n\nWindows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.\n\nWindows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.\n\nFor further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.\n\nUpdate 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):\n\nWell, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to \"replace\" 7:\n\nI also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!\n\nI want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?\n\nI'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!\n\nI love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.\n\nEnd Update 9-16-2014 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update)</td><td>01 10, 2013</td><td>A10P8UG177H2XR</td><td>cyharriscat</td><td>null</td><td>Despite the high price, it's the choice-if you can't get a legal Family Pack</td><td>1357776000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B008H3SW4I</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>EDIT, 1/30/13:  I bought two Win8 upgrades of the twin DVDs for each 32-bit and 64-bit.  I will install them on laptops whose drives are easily switched out post-clone, so not to disturb the original drives.  In short, clone original drive, switch it out, pop in a new drive, clone back to that drive, then partition, then put Win8 in its own partition, then switch out again.  This is one dangerous OS.  The reviews later than mine here for 1/10/13 report more horrors post-installation than I'd have imagined.  The laptops I bought for this were Dell Latitude 6530, 6510.  The other Dell laptop with an easily switched-out-drive is the D630.  But its memory is expensive.  Memory for the 6530 and 6510 runs only about $35 per 4 GB. In short, Win8 will NEVER be on a mission-critical machine, and NEVER be on a mission-critical original internal drive.  Comparable Precision models are 2400, 4400, 6500 (which uses same internal HDD as the 6530), 6600-6700.  Precision models are more expensive.  Dell's memory is easy to change (except on the D630, where the DIMM A module is below the keyboard, lol).  So if you're debating whether to install Win8, get a used Dell laptop in dellauction, DFS, or Dell Outlet.  If it's after January 31 when you want to install, don't upgrade at all.  The real cost of this upgrade is in the HUNDREDS of hours' frustration you'll have in trying to learn and use it.  For that reason, I won't install Win8 until maybe a year from now, or whenever reports of it regaining sanity and stability, come out.\n\nPartition size should at least be 80 GB, because Win8 might impose a recovery/restore file.  That file is at least 22 GB, which is the Win7 file size.  Atop that, you need space for the Recycle Bin, paging file, other junk.  So figure 80 GB or 60 GB at smallest, for a Windows 8 partition.  Put all your other programs and files elsewhere, back up your registry regularly.  Win8 forces you to be online more often, so you are at greater risk.\n\nOriginal review follows below, before the upgrades arrived.  Those upgrades are still in their little sealed boxes, unopened.  The boxes are the size of a CD.\n\n=========\nI made Youtube videos on Win8 as 'brainouty'.  My videos aren't worth watching, but the video descriptions ARE worth reading: they contain a lot of links relevant to Win8 installation and usage, from users installing, and from computer magazines online, forums, etc.  See also my posts in PC World, which often contain links to other places.  Yeah, and maybe ignore my irritation in those posts.  I need Bible's 1John1:9 every 30 seconds, when working with Windows: sorry!\n\nOh, understand this clearly:  I'm MIFFED that I have to move to Linux, in order to avoid this OS.  I'm not an MS hater, but an XP fan -- just bought four more XP Pro OS here in Amazon.  Linux will be used for internetting and email when the support for XP ends.  That way XP security will remain, as Linux for COMPUTERS is not popularly or easily targeted by hackers.  (Android is another story.)  Besides, XP's security has matured after 11 years.  Win8's just born, and its security is untested.\n\nSo you see: I'm not an MS hater.  That said, here's the review:\n\n=======================================================\nWindows 8 pro-purchase: none, for an experienced computer desktop user.\n=======================================================\n\nMight be worth upgrading, if you like poking touchscreens; for that's the essential difference in Win8 (ignoring the new garishly annoying 'tiles' on the Start Screen which replaces the Start Menu).  If you have big screens sitting over 8\" from your face, you won't want this software.  They made Win8 for touch, to compete with Apple and Android;  so mouse or touchpad, keyboard equivalents are awful.  Gone is the easy way to shut down, close a window, open multiple windows, change options.  It's all hide-and-seek now.  Plus, the screen response is MUCH slower.  You're supposed to get the thrill of watching a 'page' turn, the screen glide horizontally.  So it's DELIBERATELY slower.  Blecch.\n\nMS chirpers boast about 'fast boot times'.  Honey, I had to DISABLE fast boot on my Win98, XP, VISTA, and Win7 machines, so I'd have enough time to select the boot menu at startup, in case something went wrong.  The last thing you want is fast boot times, for then you bypass your ability to STOP the machine from hanging up.  Go get a cup of coffee when you boot.  Every Windows system, if new or tuned, boots in a minute or so.  Depending on what other programs you have scheduled to run at start up, it can take longer.  But just wait:  Win8 will be as slow as molasses, just like every other Windows OS, after it ages with the many 'updates' you'll have to get, to fix the OS bugs.\n\nMS chirpers also boast about 'safer'.  Baloney.  IE10 and the OS had security fixes in the first week!  And there are still problems.  If anything, Win8 is more susceptible to attack, because it imposes these LIVE TILES on you at boot up, and you can't really use it well unless you sign on with a Microsoft Account you create.  In short, you're ONLINE most of the time, that's what this OS is designed for;  so, you'll be under more attack, not less.\n\n==========================================\nWindows 8 contra-purchase:  keep reading this review. :)\n==========================================\n\nA) I bought it, B) I hate it, and C) it hasn't even arrived yet.  Bought it, because of the January 31 deadline, and needed to get that product key for the Media Center so at least I can play my DVD drive so I can maybe INSTALL something after Win8 disables the drive, post-installation.  NOTE: if you install 'plain' Win8, your DVD drive will become disabled;  but if you use the PRO upgrade here, the DVD/CD drives are supposed to keep working.  Will see.\n\nB) Hate it, for 3000 reasons, most of which are covered by other reviewers, to wit:\n=======================================================\n1.  Installation is VERY GLITCHY.\n=======================================================\n\nSo be sure to clone your existing drive with Clonezilla (be sure the destination clone drive is about the same size as the original);  both Clonezilla and the destination drives (i.e., from Jacob's parts) are here in Amazon.  Expect your drivers not to work, your internet not to work (way to go, MS, disable the customer from troubleshooting your buggy installer), your programs not to work, if you install ON TOP OF the existing OS.  Better still, first partition your drive (if drive is greater than 100 GB), and install Win8 on a newly-created and formatted PARTITION.  You can do that with Clonezilla, too (which is a flavor of Linux), but most recommend you partition a Windows disk with Windows.  So maybe do that first, before you clone.  Then do a 'custom' install to install to the partition.  Oh: and keep your data on a different drive, because from Win7 forward, RESTORE and REFRESH don't exactly work as advertised.  You lose data and programs sometimes yes, sometimes no.  NOTHING BEATS CLONING.  For the clone drive is a live and bootable copy of your hard drive.  DO IT.\n\nREMOVE any anti-virus or disk management software prior to installation, if you'll not do a clean install.  The reviews I've read often report aborted installations due to those things (i.e., Kapersky, Norton, Acronis) being on the machine.\n\nMAKE SURE that UEFI boot is NOT enabled;  Windows 8 changes your BIOS, if UEFI is enabled, and you really don't want that -- it will be very difficult to recover your old system if it's enabled and you decide Win8 is not for you. Basically, a 'UEFI' is a traffic cop between your OS and your machine which stops any boot without a pre-authorized 'signature' being sent to the computer;  so, your machine is effectively DEAD. But how to do this?  First, if your machine is about a year old, you may have this problem;  even then, it seems to affect only 64-bit installations.  Google on 'uefi boot option', and then find superuser(dot)com for the most comprehensive explanation on this problem I could find.  (I can't put the link in here.)\n\nSo: if you have it, you should see something like 'Legacy' or 'UEFI' on a screen, waiting for you to select it; should be in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  If you select/enable UEFI, then maybe you won't be able to dual-boot with some other OS, later;  because, some systems thereafter HIDE the option.  So that's a problem, for Win8 DOES NOT UNINSTALL, as the instructions to the upgrade here in Amazon, warned.  If UEFI is enabled, not sure you can even clone back, to get rid of Win8. For the UEFI option creates a hidden partition on your hard drive which runs first in the boot sequence -- and maybe you can't reformat that partition, either.  Real pain in the neck.\n\nNOTE: if you don't see a 'UEFI' option, you probably don't have it, so your computer will NOT be locked by Win8 installation.  Win8 is supposed to warn you it can't use 'secure boot', when you install: if it does, SMILE BROADLY, grateful to Heaven you're not religiously tyrannized from deciding how YOU want to use your own machine!\n\nNOTE 2: Apparently all Dell workstations and mobile machines beginning with the Latitude 6410 (or near that vintage), have this 'UEFI' option, and you CAN turn it off (by selecting 'Legacy', instead);  the UEFI thingy began with Windows 7, in 2009.  So if your machine is older than that, you don't have it;  if you don't have Win7, you don't have the UEFI problem;  and if you have Windows 7, you'd already know about UEFI, as that was an issue in Windows 7 installation. One final way to check:  do you have an 'MBR' (master boot record) partition?  If 'yes', then likely you DO NOT have UEFI, because then an option to 'enable' it (radio button next to 'UEFI' in system setup) would be present.  Whew.\n\nMAKE SURE that AHCI is enabled.  Again, settings are in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  Older machines might not have AHCI, or might not have it enabled.  AHCI controls how your DVD drives work, versus your other storage (like, your internal hard drive).  Apparently Win8 glitches up if AHCI isn't enabled, as reported by some users on the internet.  Again, if you don't see an option to enable it, don't worry.\n\n===> What's great about this Amazon deal (hence at least one star) is that you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit disks.  FAR BETTER TO USE THE DISKS THAN TO DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM FROM MICROSOFT.  Most installation complaints are by people who downloaded from Microsoft for the $15 or $40.  Many problems reported:  aborted installations with many retries;  12+ hours simply to download (for MS servers control the rate, not your IP); worst of all, the download was keyed to the computer used, so (example) if you were on 32-bit Vista at the time, you got a 32-bit Win8 keyed to THAT Vista machine.  In short, the MS download is CUSTOMIZED, not generic.  So if you value your sanity, get these disks here in Amazon, instead. Pay the extra $27-52 here, unless you love waste and pain.\n\n===> here, you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit, as just said.  So look: I can install Win8, yell at it, then uninstall via clone-back and install Win8 later on something else -- probably also test 64-bit (to test DOSBOX and Taos Computing's DOS emulator).  So I get two experiences for the price of one.  The 64-bit use might actually be worthwhile.  Will see.\n\n=====================================\nDVD/CD Read/Write/PLAY ISSUES, post-installation:\n=====================================\n\nAllegedly, if you're installing Win8 Pro from these disks instead of downloading from MS, your DVD drive will still work, afterwards.  I'm not taking any chances, but will download VLC player (which also works in Linux) before I shut down, post-install.  I actually plan on triple-partitioning the drive, with the existing OS first (which will likely be Vista), then Linux in some flavor, leaving a third partition for Win8. I will then custom install it to that third partition, in 32-bit.\n\nIMPORTANT:  Windows Media Player won't necessarily work in Win8.  Instead, to play DVDs, you'll need the 'free' Media Center.  To get that, you have to go online to MS and give them your email, wait for a 'product key' to be mailed to you, which you have to use AFTER installing Win8 but BEFORE January 31.  Supposed to be five per customer, but to get that, you have to use five email addresses. If you do NOT install the 'free' version prior to January 31, your product key won't work.\n\nSUGGESTION: Bite the bullet and pay for Media Center ($10!) after January 31, downloading it then from MS.  The downloaded PAID version will enable your Blu-Ray player;  the 'free' version will disable the Blu-Ray player.  LOL can MS give you more DISincentive to buy?  Did the people who designed this OS sit around a conference table with lattes, asking each other, 'how can we best alienate the customer, today?'\n\n=======================================================\n2.  COMPATIBILITY with hardware is also very glitchy.\n=======================================================\n\nAfter reading 3000 reviews here in Amazon, new egg, TigerDirect and elsewhere (i.e., in comments and in computer magazines), it seems that the following hardware is problemmatic when Win8 installs (please add comments if I missed your own hardware glitch):\n\n* HP/Compaq computer and printer hardware -- they won't allow you to back-grade to Win7, but apparently the drivers in HP when you're not YET on Win8, don't function after Win8 installation.  Lots of problems reported, here in Amazon.\n* Sony -- Sony has a lot of proprietary adjustments in their stuff, and it works or often fails when Windows installations are done.\n*Graphics Cards, Nvidia or ATI Radeon -- problems with the drivers not being compatible.\n*Touchpads -- maybe won't work post-installation.\n*PROCESSORS -- Pentium 4 won't work, but Windows 8 advisor claims it will.  Some other processors might not work, as well.  In short, your installation might abort, or after installation and shutdown you might not be able to get the machine on again, due to the processor being incompatible.  But you won't know that, nothing tells you what's the problem.\n*WEBCAMS -- Logitech in particular might not work.  Don't know if any embedded laptop webcams will work.  Driver problems.\n*ROUTERS in your house. This too is a driver problem.  Some routers really have problems with Win8, so maybe first go to your router maker's site and see if there are any known problems.  Or, Google.\n*64-bit installations are more prone to problems than 32-bit.  So if you have 32-bit now, STAY on it.  You can always change later, especially since you get both 32-bit and 64-bit installers in this Amazon-purchased package.\n*1GB-RAM machines.  Win8 is supposed to be more compatible with low memory, but Pro requires 2GB, and you really need 4GB if you want smooth operation.  It's really tough to play videos or surf with 1GB, unless you have good broadband like XFINITY.  So if you have XFINITY, reserve your 1GB machine for internet and your TV hookup, or upgrade your RAM before moving to Win8 Pro.\n*Upgrades from Windows prior to Win7 are more glitchy.  CLONE FIRST.  You can only migrate your settings from Vista, and you can't migrate anything from XP.  So that will mean lost programs, lost drivers, lost a lot of things.  When my registry died on my XP in May-June (twice), it cost me three months to rebuild the thing, for back then I didn't know about cloning.  So CLONE FIRST.  Costs $8 for Clonezilla CD (I like their $60 USB, too), and maybe $30-$100 for an external hard drive the same size as your internal drive.  WORTH IT.\n\n--->  Ask people you know, who HAPPILY installed Win8 on their machines, what brands and processors, graphics cards, etc. that they have.  Frankly, you can spend $200 and just buy a cheap netbook to try Win8, leaving your main machine alone.  Then buy the upgrade here, if you're happy with Win8 function.  If not happy, you can always sell the cheap netbook here on Amazon, or to a friend. :)\n\nDell machines seem to be the most compatible with Win8.  So I'm buying a Dell D630 to use as my test machine.\n\n=======================================================\n3.  COMPATIBILITY with software is weird and conflicting.\n=======================================================\n\nWin8 will tell you it can't handle MS Office prior to 2010, but users tell me they can even get old Office 2000 on their Win8's.  I'll be testing it with DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.01, on 32-bit Win8, and other software from 2003 and prior.  That's why I got Win8, to see first-hand how bad it is.  Most of the software-incompatible complaints come from 64-bit or Adobe and Photoshop users.  Graphics display problems, colors wrong, formatting weird, colorspace problems in particular.  Probably every utility program you had pre-Win8, won't work.  Anything which makes direct calls to the hardware or to the OS, or uses context menus in prior versions of Windows, will likely not install or cause the machine to freeze.  Same problem happens in Win7, especially with respect to programs that use the context menu (meaning: the pop-up menu when you right-click, in XP, Vista, Win7).\n\nDEALBREAKER?  YOU LOSE YOUR EMAIL CLIENT after installation. Win8 is not compatible with old Win7 mail, nor Vista Mail, and of course isn't compatible with Outlook Express.  So move your mail to full Outlook, back up, then pray.  If you only use online email composition, then you might actually prefer Win8, because if you create an MS account when you first install, it will then take you through the steps to consolidate your email: but you can't compose offline.  I hate composing online, so I hate this 'new' feature.  But Outlook 2010 might work for you.  I don't like any Outlook after 2000, so will try and install that, see if it works.\n\n=======================================================\n4.  NAVIGATION in Win8 is disorienting.\n=======================================================\n\nRemember Kurt Vonnegut's 'Breakfast of Champions'?  Where the guy was in WWII Dresden, then suddenly on a planet living in a glass orb -- watched by aliens -- having no idea or control how he'd flip from one world to the other?  Win8 works just like that book/movie!  One minute you're in the desktop, doing something normal and productive, then ZAP!  You're back in the Start Screen again!  Why?  Because something you did in the desktop, actually called forth some program in the Start Screen TEMPORARILY, after which you're supposed to return to the desktop.  But, sometimes you don't.  It's kinda like going into your bedroom to pick up the socks, then you see the plant needs watering so you go to the kitchen, then you see the dishes need doing so you wash them.. and then you forgot about both plant and socks.\n\nGuess guess ugly interface schizoid operation made for XBox kiddies who have no discernment except to poke at a screen.  Just go look at the Youtube videos on Win8, watch how they navigate and use the OS, and you'll see how it works.  It's not hard to learn, it's ANNOYING to learn and even MORE ANNOYING to use.  MS hates its customers, always wants to make them play 'guess how to find me or use me' with each new OS they put out.  And in Win8, they want to control your 'experience' to seeing EASTER EGG HUNT TILES OF MS PRODUCTS when you boot up.  Really childish.  As a result, I'll gradually move to Linux.  But I still have to buy ONE copy of this garbage to learn it, in case a client asks me how to send an email or open a file, and all he has, is Win8.\n\n=================================================================================\n5.  OPERATION of value will be its desktop, which allegedly is like Win7.  But ooops: no Start Menu!\n=================================================================================\n\nA Start Menu in prior versions of Windows was handy to organize and 'park' your program shortcuts.  YOU chose where they were organized, YOU designed the folders and icons and whatever to remind YOU what and where they were, and YOU controlled how YOU wanted to see that stuff displayed.  Totally.  Well, that productive tool -- in use since Windows 95 -- is gone, in Win8.  Seriously:  it's as if MS had INTENDED to destroy the best interface features of Windows.  So of course, you can't customize the icons and background, like before.  God forbid you want to preserve your eyesight by muted shades and graphics, rather than GLARE TILES with a GLARE background, no matter what color you choose, excepting sleepy gray!  Windows 3.1, all over again!\n\nHere, the MS chirpers will chorus that many THIRD PARTY add-ins restore your Start Menu.  Not really. There are hundreds of these programs you must TRY and then INSTALL and then USE to recover some of the functionality you had.  But now you spent effort and time searching through all these programs; every update to Win8, will maybe necessitate updating these programs, too.  So guess what? Now your day is spent on tweaking and updates.. not on working.  Did someone in Redmond call an in-house meeting, on 'How To Create World Inflation. Quickly'?\n\nSo I wonder how No-Win8, will truly resemble Win7.  XP is far better than both; but Win7 happily formats DVDs; its MovieMaker 6.0 is fabulous.  Win7's Help actually helps (what a shock).  Excepting Explorer (that Win8 essentially obliterates) Win7's reorganized options are pretty decent and intuitive.  So I'm dying to see if I can override Win8's interface the way I overrode Win7, resulting in a 'classic' interface (meaning, like Win98, replete with Start Menu!) across all my (soon to be 14) Windows machines.  See my 'Vista versus Win7' thread in PC World, if you're interested in that.\n\n======================\n\nC) So my Win8 Pro upgrade will arrive in a few days, allowing me to buy a Dell D630 for Win8 installation.  Someone here in the Amazon comments said that model worked well with Win8. The Dell machine's design is fabulous -- internal hard drive, just slides out after removing two screws on the back!  Machine is for sale here in Amazon.  I made a video on it, too.\n\nAlas, the D630's memory is slow, only 800MHz.  Still, that moseying RAM fits the pokey Win8 OS:  for you are expected to SIGH or drool,  while its tiles waft lazily across the screen, just as in any tablet;  then, you again swipe, sigh, drool.. one 'page' of tiles at a time.  Oh wait: you can also type the first three or four letters of the file you want, and magically 'search' appears with the many tiles answering that description.  Hmmm.  So now you have to TYPE and SWIPE?  Sheesh.\n\nSo I won't do a more personal review, for awhile.  Then my rant here will gradually suffer edit. I did nearly six months of intensive research on Win8 installation and operation, prior to buying.  Still, would love to be wrong -- if the 'right' answer is good.  :)</td><td>01 10, 2013</td><td>A2LEIANN1UZTHP</td><td>brainout</td><td>List(null,  Software, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Almost pure garbage</td><td>1357776000</td><td>true</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>B009CCVMO0</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Having \"QUICKEN\" and \"FIDELITY\" this makes taxes relatively easy and accurate.

Since the 2003 version I have noticed a significant slowing of my computing but have been unable to identify the source.\n\nI ran four different anti-spyware programs, I \"cleansed\" the system using all of Norton's utilities and still my computer was painfully slow hanging up on startup and shutdown. I even ran Hijack This and scrupulously followed the tutorial on MajorGeeks. My problems grew progressively worse until I read somewhere that Norton might well be causing my problems.\n\nAt first I discounted this possibility out of hand - I mean, after all, this was a premier program that had been around for years! Their new CEO is touted as the second coming by all of the business magazines and newspapers. Surely, IT couldn't be the source of my problems. But out of frustration I took Norton off of my computer and VOIL my problems went away! I couldn't believe it. No more computer crashes, no more slovenly performance, no more hanging up on shutdown and interminable startup times.\n\nI was then confronted with finding another program to supplant Norton. I searched Cnet and came up with PC-Cillin! This program works great. I does not degrade performance one iota! No hanging up on shutdown or interminable startup times. This program works silently in the background and is literally updated daily in 3 - 5 seconds. I couldn't possibly be more pleased.\n\nThe firewall in this program seems to work OK - I am unable to appreciate a significant difference from my free version of Zone Alarm.  Spam control implementation is very clumsy, as are most other programs, and it would seem it will be awhile until we get a seamless elegant spam control solution, at least from Trend Micro.  Spyware is certainly no better than Ad-aware.\n\nFor the life of me I cannot understand how a company as distinguished as Symantec could fritter away all their goodwill and reputation by putting out a program that is quite simply awful.  I'm glad to be saying goodbye to Norton and its memory and system resource busting program.\n\nAt the end of the day the cornerstone of any security suite is going to be the anti-virus program.  PC Cillin's anti-virus program is second to none.  The rest of the suite is good, but not necessarily the best and the free programs from Zone Alarm and Ad-Aware are, IMO, better.  My recommendation, go with the PC Cillin anti-virus program and forget the suite.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Forget Norton and McAffee. PC-Cillin anti-virus is incomparably better.

Tax time before TurboTax used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions.

The interface is clean and the process is intuitive. TurboTax imported my tax returns, and all my personal information, from last year's return. And when my employer makes my W-2 available for the year, TurboTax will import that as well.\n\nIn my opinion, far too many people pay others to do their taxes despite having no extraordinary circumstances.

My categories ('accounts' in accounting parlance) have been in use satisfactorily for many years and I had no need for these crazy new ones that Quicken 2010 inserted:  \"Ads\", \"Car\" (I had \"Auto\" and subs), dozens of \"Biz\" entries, etc.  My memorized reports all ask me what to do about the new categories, they show up in lists, etc ... so I'm busy purging them all at the moment...\n\nReadability of various screens and lists has decreased over earlier versions.  Problems with reports that have existing since the 1990's still exist.  Responsiveness of the application is ridiculously slow as you page or scroll through lists, delete categories, etc - as if none of it was natively programmed.  Old (really old) bugs still exist - such as scheduled transactions not picking up the proper amounts from memorized transactions the first time you enter the payee - have to switch to another payee then back to the intended one, possibly a few times.\n\nInstead of fixing old problems, including speed (remember when Quicken was \"quick\"?  I do.)...and report formatting (remember when subtotals were in a different column?, account names were not truncated?  There was space control under subtotals, and more?  Yeah - that was Quicken for DOS in 1990)  they introduced more garish charts, buttons, tabs etc that just complicate the user experience.\n\nThey still install (without asking) irritating advertising buttons on your desktop - and of course advertise for more paid services in the product.  Look, if they gave away the product, then they can shove advertising at me in return.  But, we all paid for this.  We should have an 'opt out' box on the installation screen saying \"No, I do not want to be presented with any icons, in-product offers, or e-mails for services from Intuit or any 3rd party.\"  Oh, I cannot count the ways that I hate this corporation...\n\nIf there was another product that could convert 100% of Quicken (and Quickbooks) data to allow one to move forward and leave Intuit's products behind ... I would jump ship. Intuit either needs a strong competitor, or to seriously get their act together.\n---------------------------------\nUpdate 4/3/2010:  Besides the comments I linked to the original review, I just found a really bad bug (or really stupid change in behavior) that anyone preparing their taxes should be aware of:  For the last 20 years, if you customized a report to show \"Tax-related transactions only\", you would get all transactions for categories that were flagged as 'tax related'.  As of Quicken Deluxe 2010, any such old reports are now broken if you had categories that do not have tax lines assigned to them.  Only those items checked as 'tax related' and which ALSO have a tax line assigned will show up in a tax-filtered report now.  In the past, the tax line assignment was simply a convenience for TurboTax users/importers - and also allowed a tax-line oriented report.  But, it was not required.</td><td>01 12, 2010</td><td>AO2EURP2Y4JZM</td><td>Karl</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Infuriating upgrade (from 2007) - Avoid for now if you can</td><td>1263254400</td><td>false</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>B002KIIKCU</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I downloaded Quicken Premier 2010 from the amazon.com website, no problems.

In the past I have mostly used AutoCAD, and AutoCAD LT. Although this is the first version of their software, it is fairly complete and polished.  It is based on ARES Commander Edition, which I have never used before. I would say I am a beginner/intermediate CAD user, so the first thing I look for is software that's easy to use and fairly intuitive. If you've used any CAD software in the past, you shouldn't really have any problems with CorelCAD.  I found the transition between AutoCAD and it to be pretty easy and within about an hour I knew where all the basic tools were and had started some rough designs.  It is compatible with DWG files as well.  From a beginner's view, I liked how it didn't seem as clunky as AutoCAD.  Although advanced users might want more options, I appreciated a program that had all of the basic design options and tools that I needed without forcing me to learn a bunch of new stuff. This is the main reason I still do graphical design with Paint Shop Pro over Photoshop. I did several basic models and worked on some imports and noticed little feature difference between CorelCAD and AutoCAD (for my purposes anyway).  For those looking for a more professional drafting option, it may come up missing, but the much lower price point makes CorelCAD a great alternative for those who don't.</td><td>01 12, 2012</td><td>AIBRTGBN07D6A</td><td>Trive</td><td>null</td><td>A nice entry-level CAD product</td><td>1326326400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B005S4Y65I</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This review is for TuboTax 2011 Deluxe for Federal Returns.

That could be over 1GB to do taxes. How inefficient we have become!\n\nI just installed TurboTax Fed Deluxe on a Vista x64 system (it's Jan 7th, 2010) and didn't have any problems. In fact, it installed very quickly considering that it claims it needs 500MB (but I do have an SSD drive that greatly speeds things up). TurboTax immediately found 4 updates and asked me if I wanted to update. The updates seemed to have installed just fine. \"Uninstall or change a programs\" says TurboTax 2009 is using 343MB. It says TurboTax 2008 (from last year and still on my computer) is \"only\" 162MB, so a BIG increase (but I wonder how accurate are these figures?). In any case, even 1GB of space is not a big requirement nowadays.\n\nI will be working with this to help estimate my 2009 taxes before I pay may Jan 15th estimated tax payment.\n\nNOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.\n\nI will update this review as I continue to use the product.\n\nPros:\n* Works on 64-bit versions of Windows XP and higher (of course that includes Vista and Windows 7)\n* On Jan 8th, I used it to help compute an estimate of the tax I will owe for 2009 to help determine what to pay for my last 2009 estimated tax payment and the program did not crash.\n* I had a \"flawless\" install and update on Vista 64-bit - didn't ask for any serial or reg code\n* Probably the best tax program there is\n* Price includes federal E-File\n* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition\n\nCons:\n* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?\n* Annoying \"smart\" input entries that try to format things like dates while you're still entering them\n* Bad/complicated handling of SEP contributions\n* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets\n* Doesn't jive well with multi-monitors - it likes to pop up windows on various monitors instead of staying on the same monitor\n* Might take up to 1.12GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements</td><td>01 12, 2012</td><td>A1T1YSCDW0PD25</td><td>Lantana Al</td><td>List(null,  CD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Best there is but not perfect</td><td>1326326400</td><td>false</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>B005S4Y8TM</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>Intuit is like lots of other aging software companies, dying to find ways to increase revenues with absurd complexification and attempts to extract rents from users.  With TurboTax, there's by definition an annual need for a new package, but this year there are SIGNIFICANT changes to be aware of.  The biggest, if you are preparing 1099s for contractors, is that the software seemingly requires you conduct the entire process on the Web. (Let's not even talk about Intuit's astonishingly offensive overriding of a user's set browser preference to fire up MS Internet Explorer frequently.)  The claim is that this is at the behest of the IRS, which doesn't want to be processing paper. Regardless, there is seemingly no way to prepare the forms on your own machine first.  HOWEVER, there is an undocumented way to do so: return to the home screen after starting the process of preparing 1099s, and click \"File... New...\" to start a new return.  This will override the program and begin the basic, local process to prepare 1099s that we remember from prior years.

The Irish side of my family is probably really easy to find, as it is about as Irish as you can get, without the O' in front of it. The family story was always that my grandfather removed the O' when he arrived at Ellis Island. It turned out that it was HIS father who removed the O'.\n\nBut for me, the most interesting of all, and probably the least likely to be found, is the Northern Mexican part of my heritage. Luckily, I interviewed my grandfather about our heritage when he was in his 70s, and learned of family names that none of us knew anything about. This information is difficult to come by, even with access to Ancestry.com.\n\nI never understand why they include books with computer programs. Why? Why not make a simple file that can be updated as necessary?\n\nI've seen the commercial - \"Oh, my daddy was 2!\" and thought, \"No kidding.\" But this was a lot more fun than I thought it would be.

I did have some issues loading this software, as it resulted in errors the first time. The second attempt worked fine and with my protection in place, I was ready to use my laptop and feel good knowing that the eyes and ears of Kaspersky were there, watching my every move and the moves of those around me, keeping me safe from harm.\n\nKaspersky Internet Security has served me well so far and one of my greatest areas of praise is with speed. It hasn't slowed down my laptop and doesnt annoy me with the constant pop- up requests to perform additional functions and/or purchase additional services. The slowdowns are the main reason I dislike certain internet security software, but the popups reminding me to do things- usually for an added fee- are also frustrating. With Kaspersky, there are no slowdowns or annoying pop- ups. I only get a few simple, helpful messages from time to time about the health of my laptop and problems the scan has encountered. This is what I want in an internet security software: Protection that works in the background while I go about my day.\n\nThis Kaspersky software is good for PCs, MACS, smartphones, tablets, etc. and makes a great one- time product for overall protection. I have not used it on my smartphone, but it has performed well on my laptop and PC, keeping my computer running smoothly without any slowdowns.

Even though I am a fan of TT, I do have a few gripes about the software.  One of my main gripes is that I think that there are too many versions of this software.  I really wish they would sell one turbo tax that allows you within the software to use the version you need and then charge you accordingly instead of having to figure out which version to purchase and get.  In my case, I have mutual funds, so do I get deluxe or premier?  I don't really handle the sales of the investments within the funds but I do know the fund management company does move things around from time to time.  So what do you do? I have used deluxe in the past with no issues but elected to go with premier because of its advertised extra help on investments.  How much this extra help is and whether it is worth it to go from deluxe to premier remains to be seen and I will update once I file.  I just personally think these multiple versions are confusing the for the average consumer who isn't familiar with the type of product that they would need for their tax filing.  The TT website helps some with this but still I still leaves too much confusion for some.\n\nTurboTax has also increased the price a bit of this software (which can be pricey depending on the version you need) that is essentially the same (with some changes for the new tax year which occurs every year) as the previous years version.  I am just not sure what changes justify this increase.\n\nIn addition to the upfront cost of the software purchase, is one of my complaints that I have year after year is the additional cost that TT charges you for e-filing with the state.  This little detail is usually hidden away in the fine print and can cost you up to 36 bucks to e-file for each state.  Really??  It costs that much extra to electronically transfer data to the state for filing??  I think that this should be a little more reasonably priced especially considering you are paying what you are for the software or in this case, the yearly use of the software.\n\nAnother small complaint is the numerous updates that TT has throughout the tax season, I can understand and appreciate the state and federal tax form updates as sometimes states make last minute changes, but the one thing that I don't understand are the updates for bug fixes for the program interface, which like I said, has changed very little in the last few years.  You would think that TT would have that part of the program squared away for the given year without having changes in the program throughout the year even after the filing date expiration.  I mean how do you explain to the IRS that you have a miscalculation due to a bug in your software (although to be fair to TT, that has never happened to me).\n\nFor all my complaints though you would think I don't like this program but that is not true.  I like this program for my taxes and I think it is the best tax software out there.  It is quick, easy, and does a good job at helping you get your taxes done correctly with a pretty good and accurate return and I recommend it for those of you wanting to do your own taxes.  Even though the software is pricey, it is cheaper than going to a tax preparer, especially if you have to file for something other than the EZ form.\n\nAs far as pricing and the promotion here with Amazon, I am less than impressed.  I would prefer a better price and better promotion than having to subscribe to prime to get 10 bucks off or spend on a gift card.  I would have preferred last years deal with better pricing and a chance to get 30 bucks off Quicken.  If you shop around, there are places that have the premier version for $59 bucks and you don't have to subscribe to prime.</td><td>01 12, 2014</td><td>A3F8T3BRXRX5P3</td><td>JWINK</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC/Mac Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Best tax software out there</td><td>1389484800</td><td>false</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>B003VTYLI4</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I purchased this program for works my pictures.\nPros:\n1) graphical interface is nice.\n2) The tool very similar photoshop cs5\n3)The tool level is wonderfull\n4) The tool fix efects is good.\nCons\n1) Very slowly\nI recomended only light works</td><td>01 12, 2014</td><td>A28I5UM0FT3I6T</td><td>Joshua</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Limited</td><td>1389484800</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00MYXUBVE</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>When they say Basic, they really mean it.

After install I could not open the Trend Micro main consol and I did not have an icon on the system tray either, in fact it was not running. I contacted support via email. I suspected that a previous trial version of Trend Micro might be the cause of the problem and I said so in the email. It took days before I got any response and the responses I got were nonsensical and did not answer my direct question about previous editions. So I finally called instead. The woman who helped me this time was efficient and agreed with me that it must be the previous edition. The issue was fixed in half an hour by cleaning out old+new Trend Micro. Then I installed again and --> BINGO, now it worked. I should add that the operating system is Windows Vista Home Premium. I am not sure that could have something to do with as well.\n\nLesson learned\n\n- Don't bother with email support\n\n- Call them. But you need to call before 8PM PST.\n\n-------------------------\nRunning Trend Micro Anti Virus + Anti Spyware\n\nOn the first scan it cleaned up four cookies. Since then it has protected the computer (my daughter's computer). What I like about Trend Micro 2010 is that it runs without bothering you with notifications and approval dialog boxes (unlike Norton). Anti Virus software should not take over the computer. The Quick Scan is fast and the console is intuitive and easy to use. I have not noticed that this version of Trend Micro slows down the computer a lot. My McAffee significantly slows down the system on two other computers that I own. However, a previous version of Trend Micro Pro (not his edition) also had a tendency to slow things down. Yet another previous version of Trend Micro once had a false positive by which I mean that it detected a virus that was not there. The false positive caused me some embarrassment because I accused someone of sending viruses when they weren't. This version has not done anything mischievous so far but I have not had it very long. So far it is running smoothly, it is unobtrusive, and is not a CPU hog. Considering the installation problems I had I feel that I can only give it three stars. I recommend it, but unenthusiastically.</td><td>01 13, 2010</td><td>A1JZLZGQZ62RSO</td><td>Thomas Wikman</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Old editions messes up the installation of this edition</td><td>1263340800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1413313728</td><td>List(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51tT9F1vU8L._SY88.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eK47Jgu6L._SY88.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gCFWKv8aL._SY88.jpg)</td><td>5.0</td><td>This program is ideal for the small business owner and home-based business.

The software also comes with pre-made character templates for getting started immediately, as well as a custom character making tool for quickly creating your own characters.\n\n  What I dislike about the software are all the limitations. I understand that the Debut version is supposed to be the lesser of the two versions, but I felt that some of the limitations may have been a bit unreasonable. Everytime I had a new idea for a cartoon, there always seemed to be a new limitation preventing me from making it. You cannot make animations longer than 2 minutes, or greater than 3000 frames. You also can't add more than two audio tracks, despite how short they may be, making dialogue a very difficult thing to add to your cartoons.

Also, I loved being able to assign stars to each photo.  That helps me quickly find my favorites instead of hunting through thousands of photos.  That was where my happiness with this product ended, though.  I got it so that I could edit some home videos that had been shot at the wrong speed, hoping I could correct the speed in this package.  That didn't happen.  I found the page in the PDF manual explaining how to change the speed, but there were no images showing me how to get to the menu or button I had to click on to access the speed adjustment.  I could not find it on the timeline, which is where it is supposed to be located.  Then I tried playing the training DVD, which would not play.  I went back through the startup slide show, and this did not help either.  My project is dead in the water.  I wanted this mainly for editing videos and I can't figure out how to do it.  I gave this 3 stars because I think if I could view the DVD, I would like it better, and it is laid out well on the screen for editing.  It's not intuitive, though.

I didn't notice any changes.\n\nNote: I'm not giving out any legal advice as I do not have any legal knowledge.\n\nOddly enough before I could even review this software, I had a family crisis which led to me learning a little bit more about wills and trusts and how important they are to a family.

Personally I find \"Trust\" software valuable, but not totally liking the online/expiration part of it.  As a very longtime user of Quicken QuickBooks, I know the old upgrade deal$$. But on the other hand, I do realize if I went to an attorney and had a Will/Trust drawn up, then had to return for changes a year or three down the road, it isn't like they are going to do it for free. So, considering the price point, if I had to upgrade/renew later I am sure it would still be a better deal.  And yet, some people may opt for the knowledge of a qualified estate planner attorney at much more expense.\n\nI recommend doing a little research on estate planning, wills and trusts.

I used to get an error that indicated that the program was not working properly every time I ran my computer.  2005 only does that on occasion.  The 3 stars I gave this program take into account that I haven't had any better luck with McAfee or Panda and when this is working (which is most of the time now) it seems to do its job very well.  One feature I really like is banner blocking--it just removes those annoying flashing banners that you see on most sites (ex. \"You're the 1,000,000th visitor and you won a free DVD player! CLICK HERE!\").  So far this has worked perfectly for me.  I also like the firewall better than any other software firewall I have ever used.  Parental controls, on the other hand, are fairly useless--the program seems to crash more often when I have them turned on and yet many objectionable sites are not blocked). Another con is that there is a documented conflict with \"Creative Media Source GO!\"; if you have both load on start up, Internet Security will not function (if you let IS load first and then manually start Media Source, however, it is OK).\n\nAll in all, I would only recommend this product if you can get it for \"Free after rebates\"--a deal that comes up fairly often, if you are looking for it (you will still pay taxes and any postage, depending on your state).

The others I run about once a month, more frequently if we're adding or removing lots of programs.\n\nIn testing Spyware Doctor, I used my laptop as the first guinea pig.  Initially I booted the computer up and measured the time it took - just under a minute.  Without running any regular scans, I uninstalled all the above named products, and re-booted twice, again checking the time it took - again just under a minute.\n\nI installed Spyware Doctor and did two boots - checking the clock on the second boot - startup now takes nearly 3 minutes.\n\nI updated Spyware Doctor and ran a full scan.  The Doctor caught 7 groups of items, 1 'critical' and the rest 'negligible'.  After checking through the list, I determined that many of the negligibles were cookies I wanted to keep.  I de-selected these and had the Doctor clean the rest.\n\nNext, I re-installed my regular regimen of free programs.  Running Ad-Aware, CC Cleaner and Spybot gleaned a total of more than 70 items that Spyware Doctor missed.  There were two critical items and the rest were just cookies and other junk that gets dumped on our computers when we surf the net.  Not really security issues but not necessary either.\n\nFor the next test, I moved to my desktop at home.  This has the same regimen of free programs.  I ran all those programs first, finding and deleting about 40 items in all.  I uninstalled the freeware and installed Spyware Doctor.  Startup times again increased by about 45 seconds to 1 minute.  I ran Spyware Doctor, which found 4 negligibles that were cookies I wanted to keep.\n\nSo, is Spyware Doctor a good product?  Yes, it does a decent job of finding and removing junk.  It is simple to use and is a great option for people who don't want to worry about an active defense.\n\nWould I recommend it to everyone?

For starters, it opens much quicker than Photoshop, so I find myself using it more to handle quick \"everyday\" editing jobs.  For the more difficult photo editing projects, I still tend to lean more toward Photoshop, but that is probably because I am more familiar with that tool.\n\nOne thing I do find very useful is the PanoramaPlus X4 photo-stitching software that comes with PhotoPlus. Canon's photo stitching software was very basic and cumbersome, but this is much improved.  Another feature of PhotoPlus I like is the ability to quickly post images to Facebook.  I also like PhotoPlus's built in support for geotagged images.\n\nOn the downside, I still turn to Photoshop for white balance support.

If you can't afford Photoshop's heafty price tag, this is as close as you can get.  It has the ability to adjust channels and full masking capabilities, where Photoshop Elements is severely hobbled for the consumer market.  There are ways you can \"cheat\" at replicating some of the unincluded features of Photoshop in Photoshop Elements, but I loathe work arounds and just want a tool to be there when I need it.  Paintshop Pro 5X also offers a wider array of image file formats.  This is especially important if you work in a variety of programs or are collaborating on a project with someone else.  If you own Painter as well, you can send your Painter RIFF files over to PSP or do your prep work without a lot of back and forth conversions.\n\nI do have a confession to make here, I am a Photoshop CS6 user--so why did I buy Paintshop Pro as well?  The aswer is that it offers a wide selection of filters and effects that Photoshop does not have.  Over the years we've been presented with the same, stale filter gallery in Photoshop version after version. There is only one new artistic filter (oil painting)in the currect iteration, but other than that it essentially has the same filters it had when I bought Photoshop 6 years ago. You can add 3D party plugins, but they are expensive; but when you buy Paintshop Pro X5 Ultimate you not only get the programs native filter set, (including the new Retro Lab), but you also get a large selection of Nik Color Effect filters and a free download of KPT Filters (which formerly cost a lot of money).  There are also decorative frames and Paint Tubes to mention just a few items. So the user has a lot of flexibility here, and the ability to grow from basic edits to more advanced work. With the ability to do different things than Photoshop, it gives me more options to use when creating pictures, but with it's wide array of file format acceptance the ability to go between programs more readily while preserving image integrity and layers.\n\nThe only con I have is that the program seems slightly unstable, but it is a fairly young release and I'm sure more update patches will follow.  If I did not have Photoshop I would chose PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate Edition over Photoshop Elements any day.  It has a deeper feature set and allows for more growth than Photoshop Elements does, as well as image cataloging and sorting features.</td><td>01 14, 2013</td><td>AO5DDG05DHVIC</td><td>Tomsde</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>A Good Addition To Your Photo Editing Library</td><td>1358121600</td><td>true</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>B00E6ONJJU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>For months Ive been plagued by Adware that I could not figure where it was coming from.

I've used a lot of different AV software including various editions of Kaspersky, ESET, Trend Micro, Webroot, Norton, BitDefender, McAfee, AVG, MalwareBytes, etc. My overall impression is that in general ESET, Norton/Symantec, and Kaspersky are the most effective. However, Norton is very intrusive and Ive had issues with Norton slowing things down. My impression is also backed up studies made by the Anti-Virus Bulletin Board. My favorite AV software is probably ESET, it is extremely effective, but ESET NOD32 version 5 was messing up Microsoft Outlook 2013 because of some faulty COM components. Since Ive only had good experience with this Kaspersky Internet Security it is pretty close to being my favorite.\n\nInstalling Kaspersky Internet Security was fairly straightforward but I had to uninstall Norton 360 and I not fond of having to type in the Activation code after installation. I know it is a common practice, but how about checking that code is valid before you install so you don't have to go through an uninstall if it fails. A full scan takes a long time but it is very effective. ESET has the same problem, but there is a reason why they are the best ones in finding malware.\n\nKaspersky Internet Security has a lot of interesting features including the Secure Keyboard, Safe Money, and parental control.

We know on the PC's it's a must if you are on the internet. On a mac it is still debatable and on the smart phone it depends on the OS you run and what you do. The safe practice is to make sure you have some protection just in case. Consider McAfee LiveSafe 2015 your seatbelt. You get it not because you think you are going to get a virus but because you don't know and want to be safe in case something does happen.\n\nWhat you get when you buy the LiveSafe 2015 package at least in my case is a 5.5\" x 8.5\" cardboard envelope, inside is a product key that you use when you go to McAfees website. This allows you to download the software and install it directly. I think this is a brilliant idea. First it reduces the cost of manufacturing and ultimately in theory should reduce the cost of the product, but it also allows you to install the software on a system that does not have a cd-drive. In addition to installing on a windows or MAC PC, this can be installed on an Android smartphone as well.\n\nYou are getting a suite of tools, first off virus and malware protection along with phising/spam blocks. You get access to McAfee SafeKey which remembers your passwords. If you use LastPass this is not needed, but it is nice they throw this in as an extra. You get 1gb of cloud storage that uses voice and face authentication. And you get free technical support for the life of the product.\n\nThe virus protection itself performs very good, it doesn't seem to slow down my PC much at all, and in the android world it works as you would expect. It really is good insurance, the virus protection part.\n\nI will say that the two extras they include I'm not that thrilled about. Password and document management is nice, but like I said I use LastPass and already have the functionality for $12 a year for password management that works across all my devices. But then I also have a google account, and if you are using this on android you do too. With Google you get Drive which allows you to have a lot more than 1 gb of storage for free. The benefit of McAfee is it does do voice and face authentication, but personally I use two factor authentication through google so I feel safe.\n\nDon't buy this for the password management and document storage, buy it for the anti-virus protection. It's nice that this allows you to install it on all of your devices, you are not limited to one or two. In fact it doesn't say what the limit it, just \"subject to limitation on reasonable use and purpose of the product.\" whatever that means.

I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes.\n\nThere is a new format this year and I'm not quite sure I like it.  It could be that I'm use to the old format.  However, the program still takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.\n\nI tried Taxcut in the past because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).\n\nI have to agree that the advertising included in the product (for more Intuit products) now borders on the ridiculous and the program (like all programs) needs more space and more resources each year but I still think that is better that the competition.\n\nMy advice: TurboTax is still the best tax prep software.

It seems I've tried everything out there at least once: Norton/Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro, Zone Alarm, Avast, Kaspersky, etc.  I'll compare this product to the ones I have come across.\n\nIn terms of user friendliness, I give this product a 4.5/5.  It's visually oriented, without any complex menus and submenus to deal with.  Reminds me of Norton and McAfee in terms of the ability to quickly access what you need to get done with the program.\n\nWhen it comes to your machine, handling this program, it's a 4/5.  It's definitely not as lightweight as McAfee, Trend Micro, or Avast, but it's way easier on your memory and hard drive than the infamous destructive force \"I need a new computer b/c my anti-virus program destroyed it\" Norton or the \"I'm afraid of my next door neighbor hacking into my computer\" Kaspersky users.\n\nIn terms of personal security, this program is really the works: antivirus, firewall, spam, spyware.  I give it 3.5/5.  It has a wide variety of things it monitors, but as often is the case with such products, the more you spread out your resources, the fewer bugs you catch.  In terms of variety of options, yet lack of a sophisticated and comprehensive database of bugs, this reminds me of McAfee, Avast, Trend Micro, Zone Alarm.\n\nSo, to finish off, see where you fit in:\n\nIf you are regular computer user, who doesn't go to \"iffy\" web site, doesn't download things from \"iffy\" sources, this is really an excellent program for you, especially for the money.  If you don't like this program for some reason, I'd recommend Trend-Micro, Avast (which is free but not nearly as comprehensive), or McAfee.\n\nIf you are constantly under threat from viruses/worms/hackers/spyware and want an extremely powerful and comprehensive program designed by a certified genius that will basically allow you to control every 1 and 0 that comes into your computer, you have the time to set it up and maintain properly, and you have an extremely powerful computer that can handle it, get the Kaspersky Security Suite.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Norton to even my worst enemy.  Because it's the most popular program worldwide, virus makers and hackers love to target it with all sorts of new things, basically shutting down the program before it can even protect you (great, huh?).  And not to mention, that this program buries into your hard-drive so far down, that not even a professional can't salvage your computer from the damage (i.e. slowing your computer down), Norton causes after you uninstall it.  I beg you, if you are thinking of getting a new PC, DEMAND from the computer manufacturer that you DO NOT get a pre-installed free trial of Norton on your computer which is all too often the case as Symantec tries to purposefully dominate the market with its \"superior\" product.</td><td>01 15, 2009</td><td>A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET</td><td>Robert</td><td>null</td><td>Very good.</td><td>1231977600</td><td>false</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>B001CU9IKU</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I had been becoming of the mind that anti-virus software may actually be worse than the viruses and malware themselves.  Most retail offerings are overpriced, difficult to install, and confusing to maintain.  And then the cherry on top is that they typically bog down your computer's performance while letting the bad stuff through anyway.\n\nBut PC Tools Internet Security 2009 has turned me around on this topic.  It installed easily on my Windows XP (sp3) workstation after I had removed my prior security suite (begone forever, Norton 360!), including automatically retrieving all of the latest updates.  Registration was as simple as providing the product key and my email address - immensely less obtrusive than the Norton runaround.\n\nThe dashboard is easy to read, visually separating its protection against spyware, viruses, spam and intrusion (i.e. firewall) into different portions of the screen.  Globally useful information such as the most recent scan date and how many days are left on your subscription are placed in immediate view - no digging required.  Click any of the protection panes and you get detailed information including helpful links for setting runtime options and viewing historical results.  It's all very user-friendly and intuitive.\n\nPC Tools really shines during routine use.  Aside from the times when it was running an update, the software's footprint was very manageable, both in terms of CPU and memory usage.  So no more slowdowns during browsing.  And it manages to provide this protection without cluttering up your browser with any branded toolbar nonsense - imagine that, Norton!\n\nIts schedule, thresholds and notifications are all simple to customize so that you get the level of protection that you want without going overboard with non-stop messages and warnings.  Their IntelliGuard feature is aimed at ensuring ongoing protection while not overloading the average user with technical minutiae.  Let's face it - the average Internet user doesn't know (or even want to know) hot to properly configure his or her firewall.  IntelliGuard does a good job of doing it for the user, sparing a lot of the confusion which can actually lead to loopholes in security.\n\nIts scans seem to be very thorough - it immediately picked up lots of resident malware and other nonsense that Norton had quietly let live on my PC for who knows how long.  This version also touts a new \"Behavior Guard\" feature that supposedly catches potential threats based on monitoring suspect activity in the OS of your computer.  Put another way, a virus doesn't have to become \"known\" and added to everyone's update list for you to be protected from it.  How well does it work?  Well, that's difficult for the layperson to assess, but I can tell you that a month in, I'm yet to have any virus or malware-related problems and I feel much more confident than I ever did with any other retail suite.  I'll certainly update this review if anything bad happens under PC Tools' watch, however.\n\nThe PC Tools Internet Security suite comes bundled with licenses for one year of protection for three computers, so it's also a good value compared to the retail competition.  This software has actually done what none of the other competitors I've tried could do in the past:  changed my mind for the better about anti-virus software.</td><td>01 15, 2009</td><td>AHNHLGKIZ2N3B</td><td>D.

They later reversed this, but I had already started preparing a year-end planning pro forma return using TaxCut.  Now that I've used the product, it would have been better to stick with TurboTax even if I had to pay extra to print a planning return.  (And of course, now TurboTax has dropped that stupid charge, so it's no longer a problem.)\n\nTaxCut advantages:  (1) it's a little cheaper, and (2) it has some limited audit protection service built in.  While I don't think it's as good as the extra-cost ($35) audit offering available for TurboTax, but for a relatively simple return it may save you from buying that kind of insurance.  That's it.  In every other way TurboTax is better.\n\nHere are just some of the TaxCut deficiencies:  (1) Interview is MUCH less thorough.  I found numerous areas where TurboTax takes you through detail with explanations while TaxCut just has you fill in a number without a lot of explanation.  (2) One-click relevent help for each entry -- TaxCut often sends you to a generic help page that's not relevent, while TurboTax usually gives you immediate specific details about that particular line.  The TaxCut online help is poor. (3) One-click access to itemized lists.  Both products let you enter a mini-spreadsheet to sum totals for any entry.  But when you go to re-open a list, TurboTax takes you right to the list, while TaxCut just gives you a menu of all the lists in your return, with no hint of which is which other than Form and Line Number.  If you have a form open you can know the form and line number, but if you're in the middle of an interview screen you need to have it all memorized, or else open the lists by trial and error. (4) Import from Quicken had a number of errors which needed manual correction.\n\nI could go on with user interface and feature deficiences, but I'll close with problems when installing updates.  I went through a lot of trouble when the product said it needed to update itself, which it proceeded to do, except the update didn't actually happen so it kept saying it still needed an update.  TaxCut support responded promptly via online chat, but gave me bad advice involving dubious system startup changes.  I actually found the solution in another one of these Amazon reviews when I did Google searches to find people who might have answers.  This burned off a number of hours I could have spent doing something else!\n\nI do think TaxCut is adequate for relatively simple returns but I'm giving it a low 2-star rating because the alternative is quite a bit better and the prices aren't much different.\n\nPS when comparing prices, don't forget that the cost to do STATE efile is big.  (TurboTax also dings you for state efile.) Remember that to gain the benefit of TaxCut's bundled audit assistance for your state return, you must efile.\n\nPPS I also reviewed TurboTax 2008 when users were rebelling against the stupid pay-for-print policy.  At the time I gave them one star, but now that the policy has changed I would raise my rating, except Amazon has no way to change a rating once published.

Simple sliders allow you to tweak your images before saving them.\n\nYour first tries will no doubt prove to be eye-openers, but keep in mind that the best images are the ones that are not \"overdone\" and totally fake looking.

That was a mistake.  I'm not sure what the software developers were smoking when they developed this, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that a tablet interface is usually best when it's used on a tablet.  When you try to bolt it onto a desktop like ketchup on ice cream and force everyone to use it as an additional obsticle to their work, you're bound to run into problems.\n\nThe security hype is completely overblown.  When I say overblown, I mean that whoever told you that this OS is secure is either incompetent or lying.  I had just cleaned out a bunch of junk spyware from Windows 7 before I upgraded.  Once the upgrade was complete, literally within seconds both Internet Explorer and Firefox were hijacked by an intrusive malware program that changed my home page and a bunch of my registry settings.  All efforts to fix my browser were repulsed.  The virus had managed to not only crawl into my computer without being noticed, but modify my registry settings so Windows had no idea it was being secretly installed on my computer.  No annoying pop-up that says \"Are you sure you want to install?\"  On a side note, I have declared that annoying feature completely useless.  Thank goodness Chrome is more secure.\n\nTo make things worse, there is poor backwards compatibility...even though the desktop uses the exact same engine as Vista and Windows 8.  It's aparrently so bad that my sophisticated anti-virus never saw the virus even though it says 2013.  I had six spyware programs all scanning my computer at the same time.  None of them could find it either.  Finally, I was forced to completely erase Windows and do a fresh install.  Funny though...I do a spyware scan at least once a day.  Every time I do, it catches about 200+ suspicious cookies.\n\nMy advice to anyone who is thinking of upgrading from Windows 7...DON'T!  For anyone thinking about upgrading from Vista...DON'T...upgrade to Windows 7.  For those of you still running XP...save yourself $600 and install Ubuntu Linux for free.  You'll get another 4 years out of your computer.

You can edit pictures, edit videos, create photo slideshows for a photo montage, burn CDs/DVDs, etc. Let's go a little bit more in depth on the software itself.\n\nInstallation - Installation was very easy. If you have conflicting software, i.e. another Roxio program that has similar features, such as a burner, then it will ask you if it's OK to uninstall it. And the only way to install it is if you let it uninstall the previous software. Unfortunately, it does not tell you what the conflicting software is so this is only going on assumption. It's really just clicking on OK and next and the software is installed. Keeping in mind that before you can really use the software, you need to restart your computer.\n\nUsage - Burning CDs/DVDs is easy with this. When you put a disc in, it is instantly recognized by the software and you are able to burn it from the quick launch if you would like. I have also put two pictures side by side and that was easy to do once you figure it out. I didn't find anything in the picture editing software that allows a cutout so you can take an object and make the background transparent so it is a little bit lacking if you're really looking for a comprehensive picture editing tool. The video editor is also easy to use. You can locate videos and pictures you want to put in there. You're even able to flip videos clockwise/counter-clockwise, an especially useful feature if you are like me and use the iPhone for some video capture and when it gets put on the computer, it's not rotated properly. Overall, the features are pretty straightforward. It isn't going to be extremely advanced but for a simple novice or if you're just needing this for simple adjustments, it works great.\n\nPerformance - This is where I had to take stars off for this. It seems to have slowed my computer down a bit so starting up takes a little bit longer. Another issue I have noticed is that when I was exporting my video project, it froze the program a while before it would allow you to export it. My other gripe is that right after installing it, my computer suddenly crashed for no reason. This only happened once but I have to blame this software since I have never seen my computer do that before. It could just be that you need an extremely new computer to run this software but if that's the case, Roxio is a little bit short-sighted as not everyone can upgrade their computer every 2 years or so.\n\nOverall, it does come with a lot of features. All of the things you can do with this program is a bit intermediate level and not really for an advanced user who is relying on this for state of the art photo editing or movie making. It also seem to have a bit of performance issues so hopefully Roxio fixes this in future products.</td><td>01 15, 2014</td><td>A1ACM1CBGORBN1</td><td>Sherry Berry</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>A lot of features but some performance issues</td><td>1389744000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00F9ZQQ8Q</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>I don't have any of the other Corel products so I haven't run into the same issues many of the other reviewers have.

I could see some value in someone less technical using the software though (although the open source projects today have pretty decent GUIs for the most part).\n\nI'd say it does the job but really there's no pressing reason you need this if you are savy enough with searching for open source alternatives.</td><td>01 15, 2014</td><td>A14NA0W8ESGDSI</td><td>T.L.</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>It does its job</td><td>1389744000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00F2BA8U4</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I always run hot and cold on these photo and video editing programs. Some programs offer too much flexibility (Photoshop), while others completely fall short (I'll let you fill that one in). Some provide too many additional add-on features, some provide none. With PD5 Ultra, Cyberlink has hit the sweet spot for me, as I am not a professional photographer, but want to be able to manage and edit my work.\n\nInstallation was easy and smooth on my WIndows 7 64-bit computer (yes, it's got native 64-bit support). Start-up is very quick, and the interface is excellent - a neutral grey that makes it easy to work with your photos. Importing is easy and relatively quick, letting you get to work almost right away.\n\nThere are five main sections: library, edit, slidewshow, print, and adjustment.\n\nThe Library section is great. It's basic, but really works nicely and smoothly, gathering all my photos into one easy-to-navigate and searchable place. It's often the libraries that I dislike the most in these programs, but I'm very happy with the one in PD 5.\n\nAdjustment lets you tweak thinks like white balance, color, tone, tinge, etc - you'll be familiar with these as they're settings found in most cameras. Don't want to go manual? There are a huge number of presets available as well, for those that like to grab and go Instagram style, and they're all quite good. An excellent and well balanced set of tools overall.\n\nEdit provides the full suite of tools one would expect; object removal, merge, frames, effects, etc. For the most part, the effects are excellent and varied. The extract tool works fairly well (using a lasso or smart-tool) and the ability to tweak the results is a welcome feature. Object removal works well too, though depending on the subject matter it can struggle from time to time.\n\nSlideshow and print are simple and what you would expect: ways to build slideshows or set up printing.\n\nHonestly, the program is too deep to list everything it can do in one place. Cyberlink provides a bunch of tutorials that are set up to help beginners and experts alike get the most from the program - and there's a lot to get.\n\nIt runs rock solid, looks great, has a suite of excellent tools and allows beginners to get going while more advanced users can dig deeper.

Now I can finally transfer some of my old analog video to digital - up until now, I could transfer video to DVD, but I couldn't transfer it to my computer or edit it at all.  That means I'll finally be able to post some video of my late, beloved canine buddy on YouTube.  You don't have to be a total AV geek to do this stuff, either.  If the thought of turning your old home video into a \"movie\" scares you, you can just make a few basic choices and let the software do it for you.  All of the advanced video editing features will still be there when you're ready for them.  This isn't the most powerful video editing software in the world, but it's more than most of us will ever need.  I just want to be able to share my home videos with family and friends, not try to follow in the footsteps of George Lucas.\n\nYou also have a lot of nice options for working with photos.  If you already have a good photo editing program like Photoshop or Fireworks, Roxio's Photo Suite has nothing to offer you, but it's a good, basic editor for newbies.  You can also create slideshows, panoramas, and other types of photo projects with this software.  Again, many users will already have bigger and better ways of doing the same thing, but I certainly don't begrudge the fact that these options are included here - and some will definitely find these things of use.  The same goes for the Roxio Media Manager, which includes the ability to synchronize photos and videos with any mobile device you might have.\n\nTurning to audio, you get a myriad of features for ripping, burning, and organizing your files.  There's a Sound Editor that lets you add sound effects and/or edit and mix different audio tracks, a Batch Audio Converter that lets you convert your audio files to different formats, and a program that allows you to record analog audio from LPs and tapes (a Recording Setup Guide shows you how to hook the different components together).  If you're as old as I am, you have a lot of great music on LP and tape that you would love to have easier access to.  Roxio's Data and Backup utilities help you back up your important data files, a Disc Gallery lets you index all of the files on your discs, and Express Labeler and Label Creator make it easier to keep your discs organized.\n\nI've just tried to give you a quick overview of the many different features included in this software package.  Suffice it to say that this thing will give you plenty of bang for your buck.  Chances are that you're going to have different software programs you prefer to use for different things, but Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is such a complete package of products that you're sure to find a use for it in a number of different ways.  I might still use ITunes for my music, Fireworks for my photo editing, and Windows Movie Maker for some of my video editing, but I'm still quite happy with this software package.</td><td>01 16, 2008</td><td>A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</td><td>Daniel Jolley</td><td>List(null,  CD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A cornucopia of media options; runs fine on my new Vista PC</td><td>1200441600</td><td>false</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>B000VLZCEW</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>Acronis used to make some great software.

It's a great puzzle game that starts with a gob of goo. You play through a campaign of sorts with multiple levels (and in a couple of cases multiple paths to follow). Each level has the same basic challenge: get as many gobs of goo into a faucet drain on the other side/end of the play area. There's a minimum number you're targeting with anything over that minimum giving you a bonus. Also, any additional gobs you \"rescue\" go into a sort of bank. This bank is really just a sandbox area where the goal is to build the highest structure you can build with your result compared against other players across the world. Pretty cool.\n\nThe main gameplay mechanic is to use a gob to create a segment of a structure. Depending on the proximity of a gob to another already placed gob, you'll get one or more connections to the new gob you're placing. Think of it like you're playing with some sort of spider silk goo. Once you place the goo ball, those strands of connecting goo become solid (well, as solid as rubber). As you build your structure, gravity and other factors (some maps have wind or moving objects) come into play. There are also things that go bump in the night or are sharp and can make a map even more challenging. Once you've gotten your structure close enough to the faucet, the surviving goo balls will make their way in and you're done.\n\nOver the different levels, you'll be introduced to different types of goo (for example, there are goo balls that act like balloons and others that can be reused after you've set them and my favorite are the ones that ignite when lit up) and some unique challenges like using balloons to float a structure over a chasm and using physics to lob a structure to another point. It rarely become repetitive.\n\nAll in all, it's a well thought out and well engineered game that is fun and quirky. It can also get addictive as you figure out new ways to structure your goo. If you like puzzle games, you'll definitely want to grab this game and the price is great for it. There's a lot of gameplay in here (something like 4 or 5 sections with 10+ levels each) and for some maps you'll want to try them again and again to get them just right or to eek out a few more gobs for your tower in the sandbox.</td><td>01 16, 2009</td><td>A18U9BQQQ0U8F5</td><td>Grieger</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A great puzzle game</td><td>1232064000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B001AFFRM0</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I tried this software out in several languages, and found the learning process to be very easy and intuitive.

To be fair, though, it was in the early days of hidef video editing and all the bugs had not been worked out yet; I also have a more powerful system now.  I was pleasantly surprised when I dug into the program, I've been a Pinnacle Studio and Sony Vegas user for  years.  Without having to read extensively in the manual I was able to create a short high definition video complete with effects.  I'm not overly fond of the surrogate AVCHD files the program creates, but it does have the definite advantage over Pinnacle Studio (which has to render each high definition clip as you place them on the timeline)--they are good enough to give you a rough idea of what your project will look like when created.  The editor has enough advanced features to keep the intermediate and novice editor busy for a while, and it has many good output options and disk making capabilities.  The video rendered relatively quickly and I was quite satisfied with the output in the .mt2 format especially for upload to Vimeo and YouTube.\n\nI did have some trouble with  Smart Sound, however, I was unable to use the free music I had for it in my library.  This may have been because I had Roxio Creator 2012 on my computer as well and could not reinstall Smart Sound with the program without possibly effecting Roxio.  You can buy Smart Sound music to use in your projects, but it is very expensive--were I doing videos comercially for a profit I could justify the costs, but the average hobbiest is better offer trying to find some other sources of royalty free music.\n\nThe reaason I've given the product 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was generally dissatisfied with the automated movie output.  I never use automated movie features in other products because I am a control freak and want to control my projects from beginning to end.  I did try the automated movie output for the purpose of this review and did not like the way it showed video clips as separate files and did not transition them together, I found the themes cheesy, and the slideshow created with still images displayed the images too long.  If you are a fan of automated movies, I'd reccomend Pinnacle Studio over this program--it has nicer themes and splices  video clips together with interesting transitions.  If I had dug deeper, I might have been able to wield more control, but found that the Magic Movie dialogue to be less than intuitive--so my suggestion is that if this feature is important to you download the demo and try it first.\n\nLike most recent consumer level video editors Power Director 10 Ultra gives you the ability to create 3D movies that can be viewed on any computer or TV with red/cyan glasses.  Since I don't have a camera that shoots 3D footage I can't comment on how well it handles the new 3D camera output formats.  It also comes with a nice pair of 3D glasses.  Since 3D is not important to me currently I did not experiment with creating a 3D film, but if it is important to you, again I reccomend downloading the demo of the program before buying.\n\nAll in all this is a good video editor when compared to others I've used.  If you're just starting out with video creation I don't think you could do better than this program.  I reccomend it over Adobe Premier Elements, and it offers more controls and flexibility than Pinnacle Studio, but is not as difficult to learn to use as Sony Vegas Movie Studio.\n\nCheck out the video I created here, it exceeds Amazon.com size limitations and if I compress and reduce it, it won't give you a good idea of the high definition quality:\n\n[...]</td><td>01 16, 2012</td><td>AO5DDG05DHVIC</td><td>Tomsde</td><td>null</td><td>Good Video Editor If You Want to be Creative</td><td>1326672000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B007QYZ08A</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>First let me say, Corel WordPerfect Office X6 Home & Student is an excellent, feature-rich program, that has as much to offer the user above and beyond just word processing!

I loved it because it's quiet and ultra-efficient, unlike Norton 360 which is chatty as all get-out, seizing window focus at the most inopportune times. It is also very difficult to work with and modify unlike Kaspersky. Here's an example of what I mean: I do security analysis using some tools that most security suites will cry foul about. Kaspersky alerted and asked what I wanted to do. I added it to the exclude list quickly and intuitively. With Norton, I kept trying to exclude the same security tools and no matter what, it would come screaming back every time it chanced into that folder and found the tools again.\nKaspersky keeps quiet and maintains an amazingly low overhead but it is paying attention. It automatically and smoothly configures the firewall, allowing what it needs to intelligently without bothering you. There's been not one firewall notification that I needed to configure. Scans take place when you want it to and setting it is straightforward, there's no digging involved. It is simple to set up scheduled scans if you like, and it protects everything from IM traffic to email. One of my favorites is the anti-banner, which quickly rids your browser of the ever-present ads seamlessly.\nThere are other features, such as the Safe Money which automatically senses that you're about to visit a site that will result in transferring financial data. It will ask if you want to fire up a \"safe\" browser--noted by a green halo around the browser--with high-security settings. Of course you're also free to use a normal browser and it will remember your choice.\nTruly, Kaspersky is my favorite security suite and I have never regretted using it. 5 stars.</td><td>01 16, 2014</td><td>ATJE929ETFFNH</td><td>Fred Woodbridge</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Back in Baby's Arms</td><td>1389830400</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B00F9ZQQ8Q</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>I have used Roxio's products for years, starting with Easy CD Creator 15 or so years ago.

However, if you are buying it a couple months after release, that is a good thing. Most of their problems will be resolved.  But as usual, when they finally fix everything, they will have another new version to \"upgrade\" to.\n\nIt seems like a lot of negative, but it is easy to use.

The applications look beautiful. They are easy to use of course, but if you are just typing documents, sending e-mail, adding numbers things like that stick with Office 2000. Because in these rough times you don't want to waste money on something you are actually getting over and over and over again. I'm not saying it's the same applications but for users who are doing simple things in Office it really does not make sense to buy something that is packed up with 90% of features you are not using.

It started being a real pain with those pop-up notices about \"your antivirus subscription ends in x days, please upgrade\", and the only options were to be reminded later, or \"purchase subscription now\". There was no \"do not bug me again\" or \"do not remind me again\".\n\nSo obviously Symantec wants to annoy the consumer a lot in order to get their dollars. I also noticed that Norton AV was using a LOT of resources (both RAM and CPU), much more than other antivirus I have running in other windows systems (Kaspersky AV -commercial, and AVG - Free Ed.).\n\nSo guess what I did?, I headed over to grisoft.com and downloaded the \"Free edition\" (free for home, non-commercial use) of AVG antivirus and I'm much more pleased with AVG now, it uses less resources and updates faster. AVG gets new virus definitions almost every day. The AVG resident shield also identified and cleaned two viruses (leaving the original .exe files fully functional, not just rendering them unusable and \"quarantining\" them like Norton AV often does).\n\nAnd you can't beat the price of AVG!. Short story: before spending your hard earned money on this bloated piece of AV software, try some of the alternatives out there from smaller software companies that produce more efficient code: AVG, Bitdefender, Avast!, Kaspersky, etc.\n\nI can really vouch for the free edition of AVG antivurs from Grisoft.com.

The GUI for the program has changed somewhat. Significantly enough that you'll notice. But not so much that there would be a learning curve to get around when using it. The whole thing is pretty much plug-n-play. If you're familiar with Toast 7, this will be a snap for you. If not, everything is fairly well spelled out, if not obvious for a mid-level Mac user. If you can do drag and drop functions, you can use Toast 8.\n\nOne of the big selling points for this program is the integration of TiVoToGo capabilities. This has been elusive to Mac users up until now. For many, it will still be elusive. What you will find out upon installation is that it will work with properly equipped Series 2 or Series 3 boxes. However, it will not work with DirecTv supplied TiVo units. Also, you should be aware that not all TiVo units have their USB ports enabled. Thus causing an issue with connecting to your existing network. There are work-arounds for these issues. But using them may void the waranty on your TiVo.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the purchase.

Features that used to exist in the Deluxe level now require upgrading to the Premiere level.  Depending on how much you complain you can probably find an inexpensive upgrade to get back the features you need, but in reality it seems that plenty of people got upset at having to pay more for what they used to get or having to complain to get those features back no matter what had to be done to do so.  I'm trying to be fair here in noting that for an average user, the features that were taken away from the Deluxe version of this software probably aren't needed, but average is a highly unpredictable thing and many people might find that they actually do need those missing features and now they are expected to pay more to get it or switch to a competing product.\n\nRealistically both products won't see serious use from me for a few more weeks.  Once employers make the earnings statements available I'll get to spend serious time working on returns and determining the good or bad news about the tax situation for my family.  While I hope for good news in that area, I'm also hopeful that Intuit will yet again learn the lessons of not upsetting their customer base.  We'll see about that in future years though, assuming I continue to willing to give them a chance.\n\nI would note that at least one competing product (the HR Block application, for example) seems to be making a serious push to take advantage of the possible mis-steps here by Intuit.  I can't say that I blame them as it surely seems to be a golden opportunity (some people might remember how \"New Coke\" helped Pepsi make inroads against their competition) handed to them.\n\nI suppose I could have come here and chewed Intuit a new one like others have, plopping a one-star review here and just moving on but I'd prefer to be honest in my review and note the issues that I have with the product rather than just dog-piling on here.\n\nI've been a user of TurboTax for many years now.  Long enough to remember more than just this current year's issues with the application and stupid things that Intuit has done.  (I remember a big fuss over the equivalent of a root-kit that was installed compliments of one year's version of the product.  Apparently current management doesn't remember that mistake as they make a similarly upsetting move with this year's product differences compared to last years :-/ )  Given this year's mis-steps, and some problems I had with last year's product, I'm not sure I would remain a TurboTax user.  I seriously had intended to switch to a competing product this year (that earlier mentioned HR Block software, already purchased as part of an Amazon Gold Box deal not so long ago).  I felt forced into using that product last year (and I did buy it last year) as I had issues with a never fixed 'bug' in last year's TurboTax software.  While last year's taxes were a little more complex for my family than a typical year, they shouldn't have been that confusing and yet last year TurboTax caused me a lot of grief with my state tax filings and in the end caused a serious delay in getting the refund I was due.\n\nI hope this year's version is better in that area but won't know for sure until a few weeks from now when I have all of the required paperwork in hand.  Given that I have both the HR Block product for this year and the copy of this year's TurboTax product to double check things with, I am pretty sure I'll be able to e-file this season without issue as one product or another will work for me I'm sure.\n\nI have installed both products and have a couple of thoughts about both that I'll put here.  Both products irritated me a bit as they both wanted my personal information for product registration and/or activation (HR Block wants an activation code to be entered).  Neither product was smart enough to actually look for last year's tax return files to grab my personal information from to pre-fill that information out.  Given that a few steps later in the process the applications both read last year's returns and import personal information from same it seems both could make a little more effort to save customers time in that area.  I can note that the Block product didn't ask the questions about what product I used last year and/or where I purchased my products from.  It really doesn't take long to complete the information but it bugs me that I have to sit and type in information that is there for the taking if the apps used a smarter process for starting up.</td><td>01 17, 2015</td><td>A25QJBK33C4O0R</td><td>terpfan1980</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC/Mac Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Intuit stumbles with their product offerings and efforts to get more income from 'higher end' features</td><td>1421452800</td><td>false</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>B000Q6ZK3K</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>My 2008 Toshiba war horse came with this software but I waylaid the Vista reinstall CDs to get Works back.

Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.

Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.

Reading user reviews the one constant is that people just want it to do its job without interfering with the computer's performance or pestering the user with annoying popups and ads.\n\nUnfortunately for Bitdefender, they did not understand their customers and their most recent offering has many negative reviews because of how intrusive it is. So I welcomed the opportunity to go back to Kaspersky and give it a try.\n\nAs far as hogging system resources (I have a very fast and powerful system) I would give a slight edge to Kaspersky ... nothing to get excited about but it does seem to tax the system just a little bit less.

It is barely a resource hog, although with the powerful machines these days, the days of anti-viruses slowing down your PCs are long over, unless you are still running an ancient system.\n\nYou no longer get a disc--You only get a code in the box!  Which makes sense because most of the time when you get a CD to install, chances are its already outdated and you have to install an update out of the gate.  This also keeps the environment cleaner.  Although why not just e-mail the code and not send me the box at this point?  You should also register this product on their website, just in case you need to re-install the CD, as the serial key is already stored there as well.

The installation went off without a hitch, but I would have liked to have been given a clearer indication of when I could choose which of the products were installed.\n\nMy primary use of Office 2010 is Outlook, followed by Word and Excel. Probably the best thing that can be said about Office 2010 from an upgrader's perspective is that it installed easily and it isn't a major revision to the software. However, for someone paying list price for this software title, I haven't found much reason for someone that owns the same applications of the 2007 variety to upgrade.\n\nThe interfaces of each program have been fine-tuned, and perhaps some functionality here and there is better than it used to be. However, for those of us that want to use our products to get our work done, the differences that might number in the hundreds during an exhaustive review just don't make themselves obvious.\n\nMy biggest disappointment continues to be with Outlook. Spam is by far the most egregious problem facing anyone that uses E-Mail. It sucks your productivity away, embarrasses you when an important client correspondence gets shuffled into the spam folder, and is generally annoying.\n\nOutlook's handling of spam hasn't changed since I first used Outlook 2003 so many years ago. It uses profiles that are updated periodically by Microsoft and white lists and black lists that you set up to determine the likelihood that an incoming message is spam. Back then, I found a much superior spam-fighting tool called SpamBayes that worked as a plug-in for Outlook and ran circles around Outlook's built-in solution by using Bayesian filtering to learn what constitutes spam that you receive. It got better as you used it, learning which messages were good and which were bad, and you could \"feed\" it both good and bad messages to help it learn faster.\n\nAfter all this time, Microsoft still can't do spam filtering as good as that freeware effort by a couple of individuals. Unfortunately, an update to Outlook 2007 broke the ability for SpamBayes to operate correctly, so I had to stop using it. While writing this review, I decided to check to see if development has restarted on SpamBayes, and it appears that it has, which is good news indeed!\n\nIf you are currently using Office 2007 with satisfaction, I see little need at this point to upgrade to 2010. If you need to move to Office, or buy another copy, Office 2010 seems to work much in the same way as 2010 and documents created in each seem to interoperate without any problem.\n\nIf Microsoft had just improved their spam filtering in Outlook, that would be worth the upgrade price all by itself. Spam is that big of a problem, and the cost of the package would be outweighed by the time it would save those of us who have to deal with it every day of our lives.\n\nBesides some small tweaks, where is the innovation, Microsoft?\n\nFor those that have not gone down the Microsoft Office path and are locked into its solutions, you would do well to look into the many open source and free options that are available.\n\nGoogle's GMail is excellent at spam filtering, and its interface is pretty good. It's not completely up to the integration of Outlook, but it's getting close, and the world is moving to cloud-based computing with blinding speed. Having all your E-Mail available to you from anywhere is very spoiling, and it makes using a PC-based client like Outlook seem perfectly archaic by comparison.\n\nI have not explored the other solutions, such as Google Docs for doing written documents and spreadsheets, but the little bit of time I've spent with them show them to be useful for all but the power users in many situations.\n\nMicrosoft needs to innovate to keep up. Maybe Office 2010 is the foundation that gets Office mostly right, and now they can use that foundation to start innovating again. Maybe. If they don't, they will be passed by, and people will look back at the last couple of decades and say \"remember when we used to have to use Outlook for E-Mail? Remember trying to do a mail merge in Word - yikes!\"\n\nAll that said, if you need Office, you need it. The best that I can say is that it doesn't seem to be much different from Office 2007, which wasn't all that different from Office 2003. Whether you need to spend this kind of money on the functionality it provides is completely up to you.</td><td>01 19, 2011</td><td>AVBLGXSWRN666</td><td>S.

However, McAfee All Access (2014) is readily available.\n\nNot many manual controls. Otherwise, LiveSafe all-in-one suite smoothly protects household (network) devices with various most popular operating systems (OSes) eliminating the need to pay much more for the same for each separately. Not supported are: Windows Mobile and older ones, like Windows XP SP2, original (1st) Vista, Mac OS 10.5 Leopard, Google Android 2.1, BlackBerry 4.4, iOS 4 and below, which could be upgraded mostly for free, and Nokia Symbian. Also anti-phishing is not supported for older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6, Firefox 11, Safari 4, and below, but they also can be upgraded for free.\n\nLiveSafe protects against viruses, spyware, phishing (stealing ID), spam, and includes a firewall, website safety rating, content filtering, and more for some; most for PCs including a parental control. Buying a single suite seems economical and conflict free. The installation is very easy and directly from the McAfee website. No CD/DVD drive is needed, but a decent Internet connection. All functions are more or less self-explanatory and typical. Goggling an unclear question provides an answer. An upgrade covering a household of up to 5 is available.\n\nIt detects, removes old at the installation, and blocks well new viruses from accessing through email, downloading, or copying, has a small initial footprint, and uninstalls completely unlike one of the competitors, which leaves a residue interfering with superseding security programs, and which requires a special uninstalling program from the Internet. LiveSafe is constantly up-to-date. It works fast and in the background, and allows manual customization in case of an atypical computer setup. A description of virtually every case can be found on the Internet. However, it displays warnings in an intrusive way and some of them considered excessive or unnecessary cannot be customized or prevented.\n\nInitially, LiveSafe takes up less than 100 MB of memory (RAM) that is much less than the competitors. However, not all memory (RAM) used to monitor the running programs is freed after closing them. Subsequently, it tends to increase memory retention during or after using especially Web browsers. That so called memory leakage drains away memory causing the computer to slow down to a crawl and theoretically even to a halt (crash). However, it is unnoticeable in and thus irrelevant to modern, multi-core computers with min. 4 GB of RAM (memory).\n\nLiveSafe automatically updates its new virus data base via the Internet by the included 1-year subscription. Its operations are transparent in the background. It is as fast and thorough as other leading security programs. The installation is simple and fast. Everybody could do it.

It defends your computer without hogging resources and without being too invasive.\n\nLong Reivew:\n\nFor all you computer guys out there, let me first tell you where I am coming from.  I am running PC Tools on Windows Vista on the Bootcamp partition of my late 2007 iMac with 2 gb of memory.  I did not test the abilities of the program (as in trying to infect myself with spyware or viruses), I leave that to the expert.  I will try to convey the experience and hope that the experts.\n\nSET UP:  At first, I tried to set this up by running Vista in virtualization using VMware's Fusion.  I couldn't get it to set up and run.  I tried and tried but it just wouldn't go.  So, I turned off the computer and booted into Bootcamp.  PC Tools installed quickly and automatically with the insertion of the CD.  There were minimal questions to ask.  One quibble:  when typing in the password there is a screen that has two buttons:  'Submit' and 'Continue.'  I kept hitting the continue button and was unable to register the product.  Once I realized that you had to hit 'submit' I was okay.  I still don't know why there is a 'continue' button...\n\nFIRST RUN:  The program set itself up.  The initial splash screen was easy to negotiate.  Each component has its own set up panel and is self explanatory.  There are buttons for  anti-spyware, anti-virus, anti-spam, and firewall settings.  Each menu is easy to negotiate and has a number of variable settings.  I didn't want to wait a long time for a full scan, so I opted for the more superficial, quick 'intelli-scan.'  The program did come up with a number of spyware issues that it quite easily deleted on command.\n\nOf note, after installing it in Bootcamp, the suite worked flawlessly in virtualization.\n\nRESOURCES:  Prior to running this suite, I was using Macafe's security suite.  In comparison, Macafe was a real resource hog, slowed down the machine, and asked too many questions.  What with Vista constantly asking for permissions, things were getting a little ridiculous.  The firewall seems to ask appropriate questions and allowed code to run after a single query.  Overall, I had a much better experience with this than Macafe and Trend before this.  Caveat emptor, I am no firewall maven so the efficacy of the firewall could be an issue here.  But assuming that the program performs well it works smoothly.  The experience here is a lot like running Commodo or Zone Alarm.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOverall, it works smoothly and as advertised.  There is nothing new, innovative, or sensational about it but, after all, it is a security suite. For me, I felt that unlike my past experiences, this suite ran without slowing my computer down to a crawl.  It also was less invasive than other firewall options.  I also liked its simple, no-frills user interface.\n\nPC tools makes Spyware Doctor which is an award winning spyware remover and is part of the suite.  If the antivirus, firewall, and anti-spam features are as efficacious, this would be a great addition to any PC.  And for the price, it's a bargain at that.</td><td>01 2, 2009</td><td>A2VW4FYZILSXF2</td><td>Jojoleb</td><td>null</td><td>A Reasonable Security Suite for Windows</td><td>1230854400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B001C31OZY</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>For the price, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 (Family Edition) is bargain priced.  First, customers can run the program on three computers. Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security.  It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0.  But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year.  If you want more features like Tune-up, Back-up, or Online Back-up, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009.  It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription.\n\nI have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows XP for almost two months without any problem. In fact, my computers seem to run a little faster than they did when using Norton 360 - for all Norton's claims of tuning up the P.C. and optimizing its performance. Additionally, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 runs without annoyingly drawing as much attention to itself as does Norton 360.\n\nI'm permitted to update this review, and I will if I experience any problems.  Until then, I can only say that Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 is a good program and a really good buy.\n\n12/19/09 UPDATE: After using this program for about three months I took it off to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2010.  After the install and update, I ran a full scan and found a missed virus on one computer, a network threat and a privacy threat on a second computer.  This is not good, but it could be worse.  Neither the virus or the other missed threats caused me any harm.  And Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 is an incredable improvement over anything they have ever produced - possibly better than anything on store shelves.\n\nIf I could I would change this review rating to 4 stars.</td><td>01 2, 2009</td><td>A11KZ906QD08C5</td><td>Bill McLean</td><td>null</td><td>A Decent Security Peogram</td><td>1230854400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B002ABOYXG</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've used extensively Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and Gimp.  They all have their pluses and their minuses.  Yes, Photoshop does everything but it is also an enormous systems hog and has a huge learning curve.  It also does nothing simply and many times I LIKE taking the easiest course to get from point A to point B.\n\nI devised a test for how well this new program does against the others.  I took the image of a lily which I had photographed.  I previously had tried to turn it to a pleasing mauve in Elements and failed miserably. I put it into this program and within about twenty minutes I had a gorgeous mauve lily ready to save.  I was frankly surprised I had done that well.\n\nAlthough it has less tools on the toolbar, I discovered by using other features under the menu that I was able to do pretty much anything I wanted to do. Also, it seems that it may have made one tool to do it all rather than making three or four, like Photoshop or Elements does.  For example, the clone tool on this program seemed to do everything for me that I use clone tool and all aspects of the healing tool for in Photoshop and Elements.  However, I do miss a polygon lasso as this program only has the regular lasso. Both Photoshop and Elements have the polygon lasso. Next, I miss the burn, dodge, and smudge tools, again found in both Adobe programs. On the plus side though, there are filters with controls in this program which go beyond the ones in Photoshop and I am eager to work my way through them. For example, there is a new filter called Bloom that does a wonderful job on enhancing images.\n\nThe user interface is absolutely gorgeous, the best ever.  I like the way it looks on my macbook screen better than any other image editing program. Everything automatically disappears while I am working on the image too.  It all reappears the moment I am ready to proceed.  I love that feature! It is so intuitive. Plus the shortcuts you use in the Adobe programs are the same in this program.\n\nI think this program has enormous potential and I especially like that it was designed solely with my OS in mind.  I am so tired of products designed primarily for Windows.\n\nThis is the first image editing product I've seen that potentially could go the distance against Adobe at least for the non graphic designer market. Only time will tell. This is also a heck of a value for the money.

I was able to keep mine running under WinXP, but when it came time to upgrade my PC to a Win7 Pro 64 bit version, my UFTM would not run.  I purchased Family Tree Maker 2010 and yes, its a lot different, and very much integrated with ancestry dot com, but at least it worked under Win7!  With a few months of paid subscription to ancestry's web resources, I was able to make incredible progress with my Tree (over 1,600 people connected, some going back to the 700-800AD period.  Very cool.  I would rate the 2010 version 5 stars, but some things are just not perfect from a user-interface perspective (in my opinion).  I don't think it has locked up, not even once, under Win7 - so that's really good news.\n\nI then purchased the Family Tree Maker 2011 upgrade directly from the manufacturer this past Christmas (2010), as the upgrade price was so low, and it came with 2 more free weeks of ancestry's access.  I had let me tree research sit a few months, and I was really pleasantly surprised with how much data had been added to the internet resources that this program and the free subscription provided to me, in just those few months.  I'd rate Family Tree Maker 2011 5 stars too, but I really didn't see that much new or better than the 2010 version.  Sure, some nicer things in the user interface have been added, or done better (see their web site for the info) but it acts pretty much like the 2010 version did.\n\nIf you liked the 2010 version, stick with it, the 2011 version is not that different.  If your old version won't run under Win7, then get the 2010 or 2011 version, and you'll be able to salvage your prior work - mine imported just fine!

First of all, you get four separate programs, each with its own installation disc.  That you means you do four separate installs and have to type in four separate very long serial numbers.  In the Photo Album 7 alone, the program was a separate install from the clip art and the user guide, so if you want those, add two more installs to that list (although without 2 more serial numbers).  That annoyed me right in the beginning.  Then, the programs are very light on functionality and limited in options.  The photo program offers no more than I get with the free program that came with my Canon camera, and if I want more functions than that, it tells me I have to buy and install yet another program, Paint Shop Pro Photo.  I was very unimpressed.  The one capability it had that was value-added for me was the ability to burn a disc of your photos; my other photo program doesn't have that.  The paint-it program turns your photo into a painting-like image, which I can see would produce interesting images if you wanted a stylized version of your photos.  I rarely want that; I really want to see my photo in all of its glorious detail.  I already have scrapbooking programs that are more functional than the one that came with this set, which is a little bit tedious and annoying to use.  I selected the \"Hip to Be Square\" layout and tried to drag photos to the large boxes in the center of the page, but I was not allowed to do that; you can only drag a photo to the boxes labeled \"Drag photo here.\"  This is pretty restrictive in terms of the creativity you're allowed.  The panorama plus is a nice and rather useful program if you don't have a camera that already lets you stitch images together.\n\nOverall, I just felt that I would rather have just one program with all of these functions integrated into it, and I would like much more functionality than these provided.  They could keep the nice user interface and the simplicity and just beef up the functionality without making you buy more programs.  Of the four programs, the one I would most like to see enhanced for more functionality would be the photo program.  I thought I was going to be able to correct my photos much more extensively than this program allows.  On the other hand, if you are a beginning computer user with no existing software that does any of these things, this might be a good choice for you, because the programs are not difficult to use and provide basic functionality.</td><td>01 2, 2012</td><td>A3UVGHUDOY77YR</td><td>MissPammy</td><td>null</td><td>Not so much</td><td>1325462400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B005GISNLY</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>I have printshop 20.

My primary need is to have the ability to use layers and to make selective edits.  While X5 did those things, it was S-L-O-W (so much so that I stopped using it).  Granted I am running this on a laptop, but I've got to work with what I've got.  Its a newer laptop with an i5 processor and 8 gb of ram so its not bargain basement, but not top of the line either.  The new X6 is noticeably quicker.  It still takes a few minutes to load the program, but working on photos is much quicker.\n\nFor example, I sometimes stack photos varying the focal plane and then erase out of focus portions of other photos to end up with a sharp photo 'front to back' (AKA focus stacking or focus blending).  In X5, erasing was extremely laggy... I would have to make a stroke and then wait a few seconds for it to actually happen.  It was too laggy to be worth doing it.  In X6, the edits happen as I do them (as they should), so now I will be able to implement this technique on more photos.  Note that the photos I work on are TIF format, so they are large.  You may not have issues in X5 working with compressed jpegs.\n\nAnother nice thing is that I recently purchased the NIK collection plugins for Lightroom and I was able to load them as plugins for PSP as well.  One thing is you might have issues with Color Efex and Silver Efex, but there is a script you can download that will enable them to work.  Google \"Workaround for Nik Plugins on PSP X6\" to find them.\n\nAll in all, the capabilities that you have with X6 is an extreme bang for the buck and was worth it for me to upgrade from X5 to X6 just so I will be able to use it more!\n\nNote to new photographers:  If you work with RAW files, you may still want to consider getting lightroom (student/teacher version is affordable... I know you have at least one teacher friend!) as it is much more streamlined for quickly working through your shoot and making basic edits.  You can make your changes without having to convert all your RAW files.  Then, for those few that need more advanced editing, you can launch PSP from LR by right clicking and selecting \"edit in...\" and selecting PSP (you have to set the path in preferences), which will convert your RAW to a TIF and open it in X6.  You may also want to consider adding NIK (search internet for 15% off coupon code) for cool filter effects and stunning black and whites.  There's your trifecta!\n\nP.S.

For reference, I was using a i7-4770 as of this writing. I didn't find the storyboard view very useful.\n\nI tried out a number of the fixes that it can apply at rendering time. They do add time to the rendering, but I was generally pleased with the results. The lighting and color adjustments worked very nicely.  The image stabilization option works fairly well, but somehow I felt that it also lost enough sharpness that I ended up removing the fix and re-rendering.  The basic thing it seems to do is zoom in the picture a little (cutting off a little bit on each edge) and then hiding the recorded movement by moving the hidden frame around.  It definitely stabilized, but you do lose a little fidelity due to at least in part the digital zoom applied.\n\nOn the ease of use front (why I knock it a star), I did get a little frustrated with adjusting the audio and keeping it synced up properly. I kept finding that as I inserted tracks that the audio would get off sync and I'd have to fiddle with it to get it back synced up.</td><td>01 2, 2014</td><td>A2J8DE8R94ZB02</td><td>Truth Teller</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Very powerful, definitely fast, but a little non-intuitive to use at times - from an Amateur / Enthusiast viewpoint</td><td>1388620800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00F2BA8U4</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>As a professional photographer and graphic artist I use several photo editing apps on a daily basis. I could offer no more important suggestion to anyone considering this app (or any other app) than, if you are serious about changing your snapshots into works of art, to own and use at least 2-3 different photo editing apps.\n\nWhere does this one fit in? Well, it's not PhotoShop which for most people is a good thing. PhotoShop can be daunting to learn and a challenge to use. Unfortunately at the other end of the scale are a lot of apps that are just as hard to use but can make a mess of your photos.\n\nPersonally, in addition to PhotoShop, for my professional and also for my own fun time I use Digital Image Pro, PhotoBrush, PhotoScape, Corel PaintShop and Painter and a few special effects apps, and now PhotoDirector.\n\nWhat works for me may not be the same thing that works for you so I won't reiterate every individual spec of this app but will call out some of the more important things that can help you decide if you should purchase it:\n\n1. It does a LOT for the price, so it almost becomes a no-brainer to pop $50 for such a powerful app.\n\n2. It features non-destructive file saving ... a fancy way of saying it makes a copy of your original so you can play to your heart's content without messing up your original photo\n\n3. The default presets are fantabulous. You can click through each of them until you find the one that suddenly makes your snapshot look like it was taken by Ansel Adams.\n\n4. The tool to remove an element from a photo works better than the one I have used for years, and I use such a tool almost every day. No matter how well you plan a photo there is always something in the frame that distracts the eye, PhotoDirector makes it easy to remove it like it was never there.\n\n5. The slideshow function is worth the price all by itself, easy to use and extremely professional.\n\nWhat's not to like? I would have preferred that the top, bottom and side menus be a bit slimmer, they leave too small of an area for the actual photo you're working on if you're using a 22\", 23\" or 24\" monitor.\n\nI have a bookshelf full of photo editing apps that I have evaluated and never used again.

For family use onlyprofessionals and even photography enthusiasts will find the offerings and adjustments very limited. You may be better off sticking with the free software provided with your digital camera.  Some of the issues include:\n There is no ability to manipulate images using separate layers that can be added/subtracted/blendedany image manipulations will be stored as a separate image from the original\n No sensitivity adjustments to smart tools\n Saves in JPEG and TIFF only\n Its all packaging: Many of the catchy-named adjustments are nothing more than modifications on basic cut-n-paste, contrast change, high-light/low-light, and blend tools for controlled portions of the images.  One example being Tooth Brush, where it just blindly lightens up the tonal values of the selected area.\n  Below are details on some of its offerings:\n\nLIBRARY\n  This is perhaps one of the more useful sections of this software, as mundane (and limited) as it is.  Create folders, tags and albums to keep your quickly expanding photo library in order.  This is also where all the metadata is saved/viewable.  Having said that though, theres not an easy way (that Ive found so far) to search on the metadata.  For instance, doing a query on all images with an exposure greater than 2 seconds (to quickly find all your night shots).\n\nADJUSTMENT\no Manual\no Gives you the ability to adjust the Histogram, white balance, tone, and other basic adjustments.  Same basic abilities as most software provided by camera manufacturers.\no Presets\no Many factory-created pre-sets with cool-sounding, evocative names like Retro, Dreamy and Surreal.\n\nEDIT\n PEOPLE BEAUTIFIER\no Tooth Brush: whitens teethand lips, gums, everything else that gets painted with the tool (i.e. theres no smart setting).  Can erase any of that bleed over, though.\no Eye Blinger:  nothing more than a paint tool to lighten areas (eyesor anything else), darken areas (pupilsor anything else), or smudge in thicker eyebrows (over eyesor anywhere else).\no Skin Smoother: reduces contrastarguably for wrinkles, freckles, and blemishes, but works equally well on grass, brick, and trees.\no Wrinkle Remover: same as OBJECT REMOVALs Smart Patch, where you select (draw an enclosing area around) the offending wrinkle, then drag that area to a smooth part of the skin that gets duplicated into the wrinkle area.\no Body Shaper:  distorts the selected area of the imagepinching or expanding\n\n PHOTO EFFECTS\no Effects are pretty basic, but at least lets you un-do the modification in portions of the image if desired.  For example, choose sepia and the entire image turns sepia tone.  Then you can brush back color to certain areas of the photo where youd like to highlight by adding color back.  Only 4 effects are included: B&W, Sepia, Tint, and Blur\n\n OBJECT REMOVAL\no Smart Patch: works OK in special conditions, removing unwanted items in the photo and replacing with a sample from another user-chosen portion of the image.  The select tool is rather inaccurate (will eat into clearly defined edges), and no way found to change the sensitivity\no Content Aware Removal: gives you no control over what area is sampled for the replacement part of the image, and is hit-or-miss.\n EXTRACT OR COMPOSE\no Background Removal: Or removal of any part of the image as selected.  The area can be drawn out with a smart-brush or smart lasso-tool, with the ability to fine tune after initial selection.\no Photo Composer: Allows you to paste a second image (PNG or JPEG) into your photo\n PHOTO MERGE\no Functions as an HDR compiler for bracketed images with different exposures.  If you have a camera with an HDR setting (most smart phones have that too), itll be best and easiest to just let the in-camera (in-phone) software do it.\n FRAMES AND WATERMARKS\no Watermark Creator: Will overwrite a customized watermark on to your photos.  This is also where you can create borders (or frames).\no Watermark Templates: Save your frames and/or watermarks as templates that can overlaid on other images.\n\nThe is a basic editing software that will work well for beginners and novices to photo editing.</td><td>01 2, 2014</td><td>A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO</td><td>AmazonFan</td><td>null</td><td>Basic photo editing for non-photographers</td><td>1388620800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0092UELR2</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>great</td><td>01 2, 2015</td><td>A30LRB20LJ19OY</td><td>LazyPinkAshe55</td><td>List(null, null, null,  Mac Download, null, null, null)</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1420156800</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00OMQLT6C</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>New computers or CD/DVD burners come with software to create and copy discs, but that software is usually a starter edition that provides basic functionality. This is enough for the general user, but there are times when you need your media creation software to be a bit more robust.\n\nIve had TiVo since the first model came out and one of my favorite features is its ability to transfer recorded programs to your computer, where the show can be burned to a DVD. Since this TiVo feature was introduced, there has always been only brand of media burning software at a time that could transcode the TiVo video format to DVD. That started with a different company, but Roxio bought them several years back.\n\nI have to say that I have always been disappointed that Roxio has offered less functionality for creating DVDs from TiVo files than the previous company offered, but the software still works well for the core function, transcoding the video. What is missing is a lot of extra templates and features that made the menu screens for the DVDs a bit spiffier. And of course if you need software that can create a DVD from a TiVo file, Roxio is your only option today.\n\nRoxio does a great job of burning copies of CDs and DVDs as well as creating new ones. You can use it to create back-up discs of your data as well.\n\nRoxio Creator NXT 3 does a lot more than burn discs, however. You can use it to edit video, make movies and slideshows, and even record directly from your computers screen using the new Live Screen Capture feature. As with previous versions, you can also convert videos to formats that can be transferred to and played on portable devices like iPods.\n\nThis version of Roxio supports a variety of Windows operating systems, including Window 8, Windows XP, and all of the workstation class versions of Windows in between those two.\n\nThe install of Roxio went smoothly on both of my Windows 7 x64 computers and the software runs very well on both.\n\nIf all you need to do is to make copies of discs or burn data to discs, I recommend you stick with the software that came with your computer or optical drive. If you want a full-featured media creation program that can edit and create video and turn TiVo files into DVDs that can be played on most DVD players, then you will want Roxio Creator NXT 3.</td><td>01 2, 2015</td><td>A23ZNGL704AW7O</td><td>Jennifer A.

The effects for photos and video are what you would use to just add a little something - you can add sparkle effects to part of a movie or tint it like aged film, or put a filter on a photo to make it look different.  None of the effects are highly controlled.  This won't take you to a professional level of total control.  Instead this will give you an expanded toolbox over what already comes with Windows.  Instead of Paint, you can do a bit more, and instead of Movie Maker, you can do a bit more, and instead of clicking and dragging files to a CD for burning, you can do a bit more.  A bit more in so many areas gives a nice low cost tool box for home use.  That low cost is because almost any high end professional software is going to charge more for each type of software - video, photo editing, etc - than this whole package costs.\n\nThe tutorials that Roxio puts out on how to use the software match this use.  The tutorials will have tips about how to take good clips for movies.  For example, they tell you to try to film a little before the thing you want to capture and then to hold the camera steady and keep filming for a few seconds after it's over.  This gives you extra footage to use for transitions and to prevent you just cutting off abruptly.  Good tips like that, which have nothing to do with the software, are mixed with instructions on how to use the software.  This could be really good if you want to start doing multimedia, but haven't done much before.  The instructions that come with this software are about the process of making good movies and pics, as well as how to use software.  You can come in with no knowledge and get good simple instructions.\n\nThe software is also built around the basic home uses of sharing video and pics,  it even has a share online button in the video editor to upload to YouTube.  Planning for social media is important, because sometimes software will want to save in formats that are harder to share.  This software is fast and simple for your basic home uses,\n\nThe best person for this is someone who is already taking and sharing pics and videos, and just wants a quick way to boost how you can prep those files.  If you've used an Instagram filter to finalize a pic before you share it, or wanted to add some transition effects in a movie to give it a little more polish but do not want to spend a long time reaching perfection and nailing down details, then this software would be a good fit for you. In this case, the price difference for the Family version (this one) and the \"Professional\" version is very small.  So, look at the chart of features on Roxio's webpage to consider getting the pro version.  The most useful feature it adds is automatic audio clean up tools in videos, but also it has extra special effects for movies and a different tool for photo editing with more features.</td><td>01 2, 2015</td><td>ACX80IV6CGBZ0</td><td>Gagewyn</td><td>null</td><td>A small step up on all your multimedia editing</td><td>1420156800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B01637RPPQ</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>After years of using TurboTax I decided to try H&R Block after Intuit pulled that garbage for tax year 2014 when they removed needed forms from their product without clearly divulging how newly crippled it was.

Usually Amazon impresses but not this time... so beware about this issue and don't expect any refunds should the price drop from when you bought it, even if you bought it just 1 day before.... or at least buy it somewhere else where they give you price protection instead of excuses (if you care about this). UPDATE: In their email response declining a price match I answered 'No' to their 'Did I solve your problem' question and they said 'Please give us another chance to help you.' so I emailed them and gave them another chance. This time they gave me some promo credit for 'Amazon Digital Software and Video Games Download'. I would have preferred a refund or credit good toward any purchase but at least it's something. I'm still disappointed due to the hassle and that the credit is pretty worthless because I buy so little digital software and video games from Amazon, and this experience just makes me want to never buy downloaded software items again from Amazon.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, I can say that I did not (yet) run into any issues downloading the product and installing it on Windows 10.

First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return (especially, the complex tax codes from oil exploring investments). Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.\n\nI was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R Block. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It allow me to fetch specific form to make manual modifications. I can do if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. The cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).\n\nTo my experience, both Turbo Tax and H&R Block are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend H&R Block for its value. (Don't get me wrong...I am not saying Turbo Tax is bad. But it's more expensive.)</td><td>01 2, 2016</td><td>AHS6PX6H22WW1</td><td>H.

The problems I've been having is that the virtual environment does not do well with hardware recognition.\n\nFor example, Win XP does not recognize that there is a bluetooth card installed on the MacBook.  A bluetooth device will work but when I try to load the software for that device so that I can tweak the way the device operates, the software will say that no bluetooth card is on the computer and will abort its setup.  The bluetooth device software is checking the device file of XP and the bluetooth card is not found.\n\nWhen attaching a flash drive into a USB port, XP does not recognize that the device has been attached.  OS X recognizes the device first which may prevent XP in the virtual system from seeing the drive.  However, even after I \"eject\" the flash drive in OS X, XP still cannot recognize the drive.\n\nLast, the console window has increased in size by a factor of three and I see no way to make it the smaller size it used to be. The console window is a window that is about 1/4 the size of the screen; you can see the XP environment well enough to work in that window and in OS X at the same time (usually one will expand the console so that the XP window is the entire screen, but other times you may want to make the window smaller). It's a nice feature, potentially.\n\nI'm sure all these issues are resolvable (maybe).  However, if you want to call the makers of this software and speak to tech support, it will cost you $29.99!  If you send an e-mail asking the question you will not get a timely response.  I sent an e-mail 1.5 weeks ago and have yet to hear back.  If you go to their website to try to get your question answered, the site has a list of FAQs but no online technical support, such as a knowledge base where one can look for known issues and how to resolve them.\n\nMy sense of this company is that it's a group of folks either working in a small rented space or in someone's basement.  One of their requisites for being hired into their company (you can find this on their website) is enjoying drinking beer and shooting pool at the end of the day.  Nice work culture, but it would be even nicer if they had some sort of customer service above the level of none.\n\nThree stars for the software, zero stars for the lack of user support.\n\n*** Follow-up: 1/27/07 -  Another week has gone by with no response after sending yet another e-mail with my questions.</td><td>01 20, 2007</td><td>AAJOV2S9O7OO</td><td>Torrey Pines</td><td>null</td><td>Works reasonably well; non-existent company tech support</td><td>1169251200</td><td>false</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>B000X86ZAS</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>If you do any programming or statistical analysis with Office, stay away from this ripoff!!!

When upgrading to an SSD, I found out that WHS would not restore to a smaller partition than the original. Instead, I had to use Acronis TrueImage to do this - which worked great, BTW.\n* The restore disc did not detect any network interfaces on a Dell 1525 notebook... so a bit of a hassle since correct drivers would have to be found for it to restore.\n* Terrible policy of having to do a \"server reinstallation\" to use an OEM key when you use the trial version. This loses all your settings and installed programs but supposedly not your data... plus you have to download and install a ton of updates (80+ as of mid Jan 2010, and then another 9 on the \"second pass\"), all over again.\n* Not only the above, but also had to reinstall the connector on all the machines to get the connection back to the server. Very disappointing.\n* Driver problems - some drivers may be non-existent or difficult to get. I had to stick an old 10/100 Intel network card in the machine so that it could get on the Internet and get the right network drivers for my Gigabyte motherboard (Marvell Yukon 88E8056). And I had to do this TWICE because I had to do the server reinstallation.\n* If you have to deal with what I did, then setup could take you a lot longer than you'd expect.\n* Can't easily use a USB external drive to backup your Windows Home Server if you also want to backup the backups. I wanted to backup everything, including the backups, to a 2TB ioSafe waterproof/fireproof external USB HD but it would only backup the shares and not the backups. However, it seems this can be done manually so I created a script to copy the data directory to the external ioSafe drive and I will set this script to run weekly. Take a look at the Microsoft Technical Brief on Backup and Restore on what to do.\n* No easy encryption, especially to external USB drives where you might want it more, but you might be able to use TrueCrypt to provide encryption.\n* Difficulty activating even after a server reinstallation - got message number 32777 - had to fiddle with Internet Explorer settings to get it to work - see Microsoft Support Article 816897 if you have this problem too\n\nThe Test:\n* I'm simulating a failure by changing out the SSD in a Gateway T-6836 with Intel T5750 CPU notebook computer running Vista x64 (changing from an OCZ 60GB Solid to a Kingston 40GB SSD that uses the Intel 2nd generation controller).\n* I downloaded the latest WHS Restore CD (2009-11-23) from Microsoft and installed it. It placed a CD ISO image in the installation directory and I used the Windows Disc Image Burner tool (included in Windows 7) to burn the CD.\n* I removed the old OCZ SSD from the notebook and installed the new Kingston one.\n* I booted from the restore CS and it asked me if I was restoring a computer with less than 512MB of memory or 512MB or more of memory (shouldn't it be able to figure this out?) - I have more than 512MB so I chose that option.\n* Looks like it booted into a version of Vista.\n* It asked me about drivers - looks like all the needed drivers were already available (good) - otherwise I had the option to provide/install them.\n* It looked for my Windows Home Server and found it - then asked me for the WHS password.\n* It asked me what computer to restore and from which backup day. It defaulted to the correct computer.\n* It asked me some questions about the restore disk and I had the option to use a \"Disk Manager\" but I didn't.\n* Restore started about 2:58PM and finished (reported SUCCESSFULLY) about 3:36 PM so about 38 minutes to restore 28.7GB of used space according to the properties dialog for the C drive (The new SSD is a value SSD and has a slow sequential write speed of about 40MB/s - its biggest downside).\n* FINAL RESULT: It works smoothly! I did not run into any problems that can be attributed to WHS while restoring the system. Couldn't have been much simpler.\n\nOther:\n* Based on Windows Server 2003\n* Giving it 4 stars out of 5 because once it is setup, it's easy to use and works well, but the setup and activation itself was very poor.\n* I installed RealVNC so I could access the desktop easily. I prefer it over the Microsoft provided solution (Remote Desktop).</td><td>01 20, 2010</td><td>A1T1YSCDW0PD25</td><td>Lantana Al</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Good - but room for improvement - DIFFICULT SETUP - BE WARY OF THE TRIAL VERSION</td><td>1263945600</td><td>true</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>B001CUCZPK</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>Anti-virus and spyware programs offer some of the choicest morsels in the freeware phenomenon.\n\n This program is typical of its commercial genre: big, slow and a resource hog.

Is it going to slow down my computer\n2. Do all: a. Firewall b. Antivirus c. Spyware of its programs work--and work well\n\nWhen I ask myself these questions and go by experience and 3rd party testing I go back to the same product. That product is Bitdefender. Because other, highly advertised, brands get the 'recognition' so that people normally assume that products like McAfee and Norton are better. I feel that the reason most people tend to stick with those popular brands are because it involves computers and technology--areas that some people lack know-how in, so they are left with brand names. Also with internet security software, most companies seem to not be able to get themselves out there on the shelves of megastores around the globe. I have not seen Bitdefender there. Thankfully people come to Amazon to look at reviews, and hopefully Bitdefender will be somewhere down the list of bestsellers so that people can come and read more about a product that they are not familiar with, but should be.\n\nNow from experience with brands such as McAfee and Norton, I can tell you that it felt, when using my computer, that I had a security software installed. This is not a good thing. The reason I could tell is because a. annoying popups, about almost every other program I was opening, would minimize screens or litter the viewing area and b. because my computer would lag sometimes for no reason whether it was updating or not--and when I would open up the task manager, guess what was taking all of the computer memory...the security software was! It was not until I switched to Bitdefender that those laggy problems ceased. Especially with the new 2010 internet security my computer feels completely free of any software of the like and runs as if it weren't running at all.\n\nThe recommended system requirements are:\n\nWindows XP SP2, Vista or Windows 7\n600MB Free Space\nIntel CORE Duo (1.66GHz) or equivalent\n1GB of RAM with Win 7 and XP or 1.5GB with Vista\n\nIf your computer is greatly underneath those, it might not run as smooth as the one I'm reviewing. I wanted to add that I have a 64-bit computer and the disc that came with retail package says that it installs either 32bit or 64bit (automatically depending on your computer) HOWEVER it did not work for me. After I installed the program it made everything on my computer run slow, including videos, while the operation \"vsserv.exe\" would take up all of my CPU. The solution I found was to manually download the 64bit Internet Security 2010 from Bitdefenders website and use the key for the box on it. After that it worked flawlessly.\nThe link to that version is: [...]\nThat should fix any problems for 64bit users.\n\nThe interface I give 5 stars:\n\n1. it still gives the option of viewing the control center in either Novice, Intermediate or Advanced view--whichever suits\nyou best (you can switch the option at anytime).\n2. A superior parental control function to block unwanted website viewing and/or limit time spent on internet. Very versatile function.\n3. Networking with other home computers that allows you to control all of the Bitdefender software on all your computers from the \"master\". Great for families.\n\nFor the features I also give it 5 stars:\n\nI said above that I ask whether the security software worked and if it worked well. It may be that Norton and McAfee are more popular, but does it mean they are better? According to PC World, Bitdefender had a 98.9% Scan Detection rate rating the HIGHEST out of the big names (including McAfee and Norton), as well as scoring higher in the proactive detection (protecting in real time).\n\nBitdefender also offers an optimizing function to speed up your PC performance, and is equipped with Laptop Mode (meaning it purposely takes up less resources and/or limits updating so that it doesn't use as much battery life) and Gaming Mode (quick way to set up the firewall so that you aren't limited when playing online and doesn't scan or update while you are playing--so no lag or glitches).\n\nI love this product and have always been a loyal Bitdefender user since switching to it. It looks like it has not changed over the years but has only distanced itself away from companies that have to rely on their brand to keep the sales up, instead of performance. Give this one a try--you won't look back.</td><td>01 20, 2010</td><td>A1VFX417XDNWIU</td><td>Canis Majoris</td><td>null</td><td>Still the best Internet Security out there.</td><td>1263945600</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B002EAYJD8</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've used Trend Micro products for a number of years and overall, they are very good products.

Then came Nero, which was light, swift, and powerful.  For those in the know, Nero was the choice application for CD mastering, and later for DVDs.  When I upgraded to Windows 7, I had a few applications that were no longer supported.  Nero 6.x and PowerDVD 5.x were two that I missed most.  When I saw a tremendous deal for Nero 9 Reloaded (free after rebate), I jumped at the chance to use Nero again.  I was excited to see the changes and improvements from 4 major updates (9 and 9 Reloaded are counted as 1 update each).  Despite all the negative reviews, I thought surely it couldn't be that bad.  Right?\n\nPROS:\n- Familiar interface\n- Good burning performance\n- Many multimedia features & tools\n\nCONS:\n- Excruciatingly slow install\n- Slow startup speeds for every app\n- Too many below average apps\n- Shameful forced install of Ask.com toolbar\n- Updates are not integrated or easy\n- Very poor value\n- Many apps outperformed by free or open source apps\n\nFor the sake of reviewing Nero 9 Reloaded, I chose to install all the applications in the suite.  This amounted to 2.98GB of space required.  I knew I'd uninstall most of the applications but wanted to be thorough.  Nero Burning ROM is 324MB by itself.  At the end of my evaluation, I nearly had to uninstall everything.\n\nINSTALLATION\nAt the very beginning, I was asked if I wanted to install the Ask.com toolbar and make it my default search engine.  I elected not to install it.  After choosing all the applications to install, I was prompted to install the required 3rd party software, which I was ok with, except that it FORCED me to install the Ask.com toolbar!  What.  The.  Heck???  I timed the actual installation time to be about 22 minutes, during which the installation screen displayed ads for Nero's other applications.  If I were staring at the installation screen for 22 minutes, I think I would have found tips on using Nero 9 to be more useful than watching the same 3 or 4 ads cycle over and over again.  This was a bad start.  After the install completed, I ran the Nero Control Center, which allows you to manage all the apps in the suite including checking for updates.  All it does for updates is open your browser to Nero's web page and you have to see for yourself if the version numbers match or if there is an upgrade available.  The version on the disc I bought was 9.4.17 and version 9.4.26 was available so I downloaded it.  All 204MB worth.  After numerous failed download attempts and even the failure to run once and re-downloading it, I waited an additional 15 minutes for the update to install.  The update forced another couple of 3rd party apps to be installed before completing.  All told, I spent over an hour getting Nero 9 ready to go.\n\nNERO BURNING ROM\nNero Burning ROM was 90% of the reason why I chose to even try Nero 9.  Well, aside from being certified for Windows 7, it is essentially the same as Nero 6.  Even the GUI is remarkably similar.  On the plus side, because I was so familiar with Nero 6, I was able to find everything quickly and get running right away.  Unfortunately, the interface was never a highlight of Nero 6 so it retains the unintuitive characteristics.\n\nNERO SHOWTIME\nShowtime is the media player included in the suite and accounted for about 5% of the reason why I wanted to try Nero 9.  Since my old PowerDVD didn't run on Windows 7, I figured Showtime would be a reasonable upgrade from just using Windows Media Player.  While it does offer more options and useful tools, I found that the audio was unacceptable.  Watching Star Trek (2009) on it was a far more enjoyable experience on WMP than Showtime.  The audio was just bland and not very crisp.  What is wrong with this thing?  I tried messing with the audio configuration but nothing really helped.  Bummer.\n\nNERO VISION\nNero Vision allows one to take a video file, from say a Flip camcorder, and burn it to a physical DVD for playback on a standard component DVD player.  Other than adding a few fancy 3D menu templates, it is virtually unchanged from Nero 6.  This was the last 5% of why I wanted to try Nero 9.\n\nREMAINING APPLICATIONS\nThe rest of the suite is sorely below average.  I would use Audacity over the audio editing tools included in Nero 9 and Picasa or Paint. NET over the photo tools.  I don't have a TV tuner on my PC so I could not review the Nero Live tuner/DVR application but I'd guess more of the same.  The tools like DiscSpeed, DriveSpeed, and InfoTool are ok, but again, you can find free applications that do the same things.  I also did not review the RescueAgent and did not install the free backup software, BackitUp & Burn.\n\nSUMMARY\nI thought I would end up writing a review proving all the negative reviewers wrong.  Instead, I am saddened by the mighty fall from grace that Nero has taken.  Nero 9 is the very definition of bloated.  Load times and performance on nearly every application in the suite was painfully slow.  And the only application really worth having, Burning ROM, has changed very little from FOUR versions ago.  Nero sells just the Burning ROM application for Linux at a reasonable cost and wish they would do that also for Windows because the rest of the suite has watered down the value of Nero.  Even then, they would have a hard time competing against a very good free Windows application called CDBurnerXP, which I recommend for those who only need something for data & audio burning and ISO capabilities.  It takes up less than 11MB of hard disk space and installs in less than 30 seconds.  Oh Nero.

When I'm typing, I watch the screen, and correct nearly all of my errors as they appear.  It's absolute torture for me to go through and proof my work after I've typed it.  Using speech recognition software regularly would force me to do so, since I'm less likely to catch the errors in real time.  Now, proofreading is a good skill to have, and a good habit to be in, but I _hate_ doing it, so anything that would make me have to do so (like a critical boss, or speech recognition software) is something I'm not eager to embrace (I don't actually make a habit of embracing any of my bosses, but that's neither here nor there).\n\nSo, if you're lazy like me, you'll be torn between the convenience of keeping your hands in your pockets (or busy ferrying junk food from the bag to your face) while you work, and the inconvenience of proofing your work after it's dictated.

If you hit that threshold, your standard Will ends up being a ticket for up to 2 years in probate. You still want a will when you do a living trust as sort of a catch-all, but with that you need the proper power of attorneys set up (note that was plural). The right kind of protection is a legal will, durable power of attorney for finances, directive for health care and caregiver instructions. Plus of course you want a Living Trust as the flag ship. I just learned all this YESTERDAY, while WillMaker was on my desk waiting to be used and reviewed. This version of WillMaker offers everything on the list I just gave, including a free one year subscription to Nolo's Living Trust service. That's huge and a a huge bargain, because a Living Trust is an updatable document that should be reviewed and refined as family situations change, hence the subscription.  The law office gave us their price sheet to set up all of these docs: $2,950, seriously. Considering all that goes into creating a fully protected and executable will and trust and all the rest, that's understandable for a local law office. But put that into a well-respected software package and you can save that huge fee if you understand the process. I didn't until last night, although I did a straight will 2 years ago with WillMaker 2014. The software is very easy to follow and has been around so long, all the \"odd circumstances\" are in there. If your situation is pretty straight forward where you own a house and have some savings and dependents, WillMaker in this version with the Living Trust is the way to go. I'm thrilled this came up for review, I only have that will and if something happens my family is stuck in probate.</td><td>01 20, 2016</td><td>A3EZFFPVS34AMO</td><td>PD</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>For Home Generated Docs, This Is The Version You Want</td><td>1453248000</td><td>false</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>B01617VVYY</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Did my taxes and other then they customer service needs work. it was slightly better then last year and the State taxes papers were Really Really slow but otherwise good</td><td>01 20, 2016</td><td>A2NMMSLFGW84K9</td><td>A.

When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.\nWindows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.\nThis is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.\nThe acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)\nI've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.\nAs with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.\nI will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:\n* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever\n* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start\n* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP\n* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically\n* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP\n* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.\n* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.\nAnd simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.\nIn terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.\nI think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.\nRecommended</td><td>01 21, 2003</td><td>A1YK56DPXS5DFX</td><td>Carlos Santiago</td><td>null</td><td>A solid operating system</td><td>1043107200</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B000050ZRE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a PCI card to add USB to an older computer; 3 slots on the back and one internal--this card included a USB slot in a drive-bay cover, which you can install if you've got a free bay on your PC, connecting it to the internal USB slot with a supplied cord.

Both can be used for plotting trips, and with a GPS adapter, turn your laptop into a full blown GPS. Using a computer to plan trips has a lot of advantages over a standalone GPS.  You can plan your trips and side trips on a large screen, easily save and edit them, and look up possible destinations on the internet at the same time.  The bad news is you need your laptop in the car when you do go on a trip and that takes up a lot of room compared to the standalone GPS. One nice feature is that routes created in MapPoint can be downloaded to some standalone GPS unit (mainly Garmin, check the MapPoint website at Microsoft.com).\nMapPoint adds features that I feel will mainly be used for business. It has the ability send maps and data to Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).  It can also pull data from Office applications and SQL databases and use that data to create maps. Developers can program their apps to use MapPoint to generate maps that are incorporated into their software or websites.\n\nThis is a great (and advanced) product if you need it's advanced features.

When I moved to Windows 7, I needed some new video tools that would take advantage of the huge memory I had on my new Win7 Pro desktop (12 gigs of tri-channel memory, 64 bit processing, etc).  At the time, CyberLink's PowerDirector had native 64bit support, so I stopped using Pinnacle and learned PowerDirector.\n\nI'm still very happy with PowerDirector, but I decided to give Pinnacle a try again to see if there were new tools or methods that would help my creativity.  I can say that I've seen some fancy videos that were made using Pinnacle, but the learning curve to understand how to make those with Pinnacle's products is huge.  Now, maybe it's me.  Maybe if I would have not learned PowerDirector, I would be happy with Pinnacle's tools, but it didn't happen that way for me.\n\nI could not find \"wizards\" inside Pinnacle that would help me make fancy photo montages using Pinnacle's tools.  (PowerDirector's high end products have wizards that help you import photos with transitions and timings etc and it will create the video for you, and then you can modify it to your liking).\n\nPinnacle does allow multiple tracks to be layered, and I find that across most of the video packages these days.  So, cutting to the chase, if you learned another package first, I can guess that trying to learn the Pinnacle tool might be a bit frustrating for you, as it was for me.  If you are new to creating video on a PC, then Pinnacle's tools are as good as the others, so shop around, get one that you can grow into, and remember, you sort of get that you pay for so if you go cheap, if might not perform the way you'd want it to.</td><td>01 21, 2013</td><td>A3T8WOFS5RD2IR</td><td>John D Hillmer</td><td>List(null,  CD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Complicated, Learning Curve, Powerful</td><td>1358726400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B007QYZ08A</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Corel's WordPerfect Office X6 program suite provides a full-featured set of applications for all your office computing needs. It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites. For those who are in need of a suite that includes resources for word processing, presentations, spreadsheets, file management, Internet integration, and more, I would recommend considering WP Office X6 - if you have a recent PC model. If your PC is pretty old it might not handle the latest software so well, so you should check the recommended system specs before getting the software. Corel has done a nice job keeping the Word Perfect tradition going strong, as Word Perfect was the 1st word processing application I ever used, back in the MS-DOS era!

They laughed when I sat down to create a 3D rendering of a woodland nymph . . . and they were right.\n\n Creating 3D renderings isn't simple, though the folks who publish Poser try to make it easier with each new version.

They include a ton of content and the interface is usable. There are a couple of books about using Poser and picking up a used copy of one for an earlier version is a good investment.\n\n If you have the time, though, and the discipline to work through each step, you can master Poser 9.\n\n Personally, considering the low level of my skills, I prefer Reallusion iClone and Daz Studio: they're not necessarily as capable as Poser 9, but they are somewhat easier for novices to approach.\n\n But, as I said, if you can devote the time and energy to learning Poser 9 and practice, practice, practice, you can turn out truly exquisite work with this application.

When I was notified that Intuit/Quicken would no longer support the 2010 version, I elected to upgrade.\n\nThere are several very handy modest changes in the reconciliation process, and a new way to close accounts that you no longer use.  Instead of seeing the word \"Update\" in the upper right corner to use for downloading my investment info, there is a semi-circular arrow which performs the same function.  Instead of an \"Actions\" button leading you to the reconciliation process and other functions, there is a small asterisk; works the same, just loooks different. OK, those are easy to get used to.

My needs are very specific to that purpose and I made no effort to see how strong the software was for such things as burning discs or importing various formats from video cameras.\n\nFirst, let's start with the positives.  One thing I have to credit this software with is that it does encode faster than my current solution. For starters, it is 64 bit software so if your operating system is also 64 bits and you have a healthy amount of RAM then it will put it to work.  I also believe (although can't test) that the program is efficient in its approach to encoding because it really does seem to move along at a good clip even compared to other 64 bit software I've tried.\n\nAnother plus is that if you want to record voice-over audio the process is intuitive and easy.  This is fairly common in similar packages but I've seen much worse implementations.  I'd also say that for very simple tasks, the interface is fairly intuitive (considering it's a program with many, many features and that complexity will always come with a learning curve).\n\nThings I didn't like?  For starters, it copies any video file that I want to edit to another location.  I understand that it does this to allow for non-destructive editing but I vastly prefer my current software's solution of tracking the changes in very small files of its own making and then applying them during the encoding process.  PowerDirector forces me to significantly increase the space on my hard drive devoted to video and I frequently have too much in the pipeline to want to do that.\n\nAnother issue I had was the method for cutting out pieces of the video.  I routinely edit files that already include speech.  When I pull out a sentence, or even just a long pause between speaking, I want to check not just the clip I'm pulling out, but the start of the clip after the cut so I can make sure the transition is smooth.  As best I can tell, this is impossible until after I've made the cut. There were actually a lot of little things like this that made the process of doing small edits spread out over a 30 minute video a real pain.  For example, it would often bounce back to the beginning of the project after I did virtually anything at all which would force me to find my place again.\n\nPerhaps my biggest gripe is that for some strange reason the program would intermittently struggle to render text.  Whether it was text capture in the game video or titles that PowerDirector itself put in, it would sometimes render it very jagged as if the video was low resolution... yet the other video elements were fine.  I never could determine the cause, it was too sporadic to determine a root cause but this was a total deal-breaker for me.  I'm simply not willing to risk that at random points in a video, the quality will be bad.\n\nThis is a tough product to rate because I feel like a lot of my problems with PowerDirector are more a case of it not fitting my personal needs rather than being poorly designed software.  The text issue is bad, but I don't want to hammer it too hard for one thing.  Ultimately, I hope people won't use my star rating, but rather look at the things that caused me problems and ask yourself if they matter for your purposes.  In the end, the increased time and aggravation that editing in PowerDirector outweighed the faster encode times (which matter less to me since I can walk away and come back later).  But your mileage could definitely vary depending on the use you'd like to put it to.</td><td>01 21, 2014</td><td>A3OH101U0CPUC7</td><td>Joseph Boone</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Didn't fit my needs</td><td>1390262400</td><td>false</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>B00E6LJ2SA</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The only thing that is difficult about Quicken is entering investment accounts manually, but there is a work-around.

Perhaps you'll understand when I confess that I haven't done anything of the sort.  What I have done is use Kaspersky Anti-Virus for the past few years and have had no issues with viruses.  How much of that is due to the software and how much to my generally being careful about what I download, and from whom?  That's difficult to say, but I'll lay out what little I can actively see about the program.\n\nAs far as keeping me safe, Kaspersky does issue warnings to me if I start to go to a website that they have reason to believe is problematic.  I generally take the advice and steer clear of them and haven't had any regrets on that score.  The other major selling point is kind of the opposite side of that coin, namely Kaspersky doesn't pop up all the time with annoying messages that either ask me to do things or tell me that it's done something.  It simply loads in the background whenever I boot the system and quietly does its job.  I've had anti-virus software in the past that was a lot more intrusive so this has been a major plus.\n\nIn summary, I don't pretend to be an expert on determining which anti-virus software is the best.  But I use my PC for hours every day and have had zero problems since I started using Kaspersky.  The program is also very well behaved and neither tortures me with popups nor does it interfere with games or other programs as some security packages do.  To the extent I'm able to judge it, there is literally nothing I know of that I wish were different.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good no-hassle anti-virus program.</td><td>01 21, 2014</td><td>A3OH101U0CPUC7</td><td>Joseph Boone</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Appears to do the job</td><td>1390262400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00F8K9MZQ</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>You cannot go wrong using the TurboTax Deluxe Fed Efile and State 2013 tax program.

However, my hopes were dashed immediately after installation.  I installed the program on a fairly new machine running a fresh installation of XP-SP3.  Despite a problem-free installation, I noticed that I lost my Internet connection afterwards.  I discovered this while attempting to activate the program.  The application stated there was a problem with my Internet connection, but didn't realize it was the culprit.  I adjusted the firewall settings until I was able to restore Internet connectivity, however, a non-savvy user might have a harder time figuring out the problem, and they're the ones who need this type of application the most.  The program also displayed a bunch of pop-ups for firewall rules and real-time protection notifications, sometimes several at once.  I quickly opted to operate the firewall in \"silent mode\", which is supposed to limit notifications and create rules automatically, however, I still received quite a few pop-up notifications before they, thankfully, eventually diminished.  I then tried the update feature.  The update process was simple but it required two successive reboots to complete.\n\nI finally got the program tamed, however, there were still some exisitng issues.  System resource impact wasn't too bad. Web browsing was fast and pages loaded quickly, although it takes quite a bit of time for web access to become available when starting Windows.  I also frequently lost web access and had to restart the browser several times to restore.  I also noticed a few extra seconds delay during startup and shutdown, but nothing alarming.  The scanning and malware engine seems pretty good and fast.  There is no right-click context menu scan, a major flaw.  In other words, no way to manually scan individual files, such as downloads, without scanning the entire system. The interface is otherwise clean with easily reachable menus/sub-menus.  The program can be completely or selectively disabled.\n\nI feel the installation process is too problematic for the average user.  The default firewall settings are too restrictive and all of the initial pop-ups can be pretty confusing and irritating.  I also feel the lack of context-menu scanning and the frequent loss of network connectivity are serious minuses.

It is much better to learn Chinese by seeing a picture of an apple and saying/hearing \"pingguo\" than it is to look at it and think \"apple\" in English and trying to translate to Chinese.  In this regard, their method is effective.\n\nWhere this program is lacking, however, is in not teaching the Chinese characters.  It sounds strange to English speakers, but it really is true that learning the characters is absolutely essential to learning to speak the language well.  (I resisted this at first too, but luckily a college professor saved me from my wrong thinking).  I would love to Rosetta add an option in the software that allows you to learn the characters as an intrinsic part of learning the language.\n\nIf you're just trying to learn to be conversant, and don't want to learn the characters, and prefer not to be tied to your computer, I find the Pimsleur CDs to be a better option.\n\nOverall- good program - but don't fall for the hype that learning Chinese is going to be easy.

I've never been disappointed before - from Dos to Windows 95, from Windows 95 to XP, from XP to Vista, there has always been lots of new, fancy stuff for me to explore and enjoy.\n\nNot Windows 7. It is almost identical to Vista in every way. And then there is the downside: some of the programs don't work. I read in other reviews that 7 is very backwards compatible. Well, the first thing I used, a little Vista sidebar gadget called Network Meter, doesn't work at all. Very annoying. But more importantly, the intel graphics driver doesn't work, so my screen remained blurry! And Intel doesn't offer updates for my chip, they said. Luckily I was able to find the driver for Vista, and it worked in 7, so I'm okay. But this bit about 7 being backwards compatible is just a joke to me. Better watch out that nothing I have is going to work on it.\n\nLike Vista, 7's sound recorder is stripped down to bare minimum functions. I love using the sound recorder in XP; it's small, efficient, and has neat functions.\n\nWhat's new about Windows 7? Well, it has a math input tool. As a mathematician, I find that thing STUPID. I draw a 2 in there, and it thinks it is alpha. If I draw +, it takes it to be psi. Be faster to get it out of the character map.\n\nOther than that, there is nothing interesting. It advertises being able to record TV shows. Big deal; XP and Vista can do it too; just buy the tv tuner!  (For Windows 7 also.) I recently bought one here at Amazon. Not too expensive, and works great:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hauppauge-WinTV-HVR-950Q-TV-Tuner-Stick-Personal-Video-Recorder-with-Clear-QAM-and-Remote-Control-Black/dp/B001DEYVXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950Q TV Tuner Stick/Personal Video Recorder with Clear QAM and Remote Control (Black)</a>\n\nOne thing I find irritating about 7 (and Vista) is its requirement for program signature verification. If it doesn't recognize a program you want to install, it flashes you a warning. I guess Microsoft wants everybody to register with them like they are the Gestapo. There is just one problem: I have used Vista for 2 years, have installed hundreds of programs big or small, and have NEVER encountered a program that owns the signature verification. This includes programs I download from Microsoft! So the warning is ubiquitous and meaningless like a grandma's caution against life's countless dangers. Why don't they give it up already? Nobody will ever sign up with them!\n\nAnother thing is, they won't let me put a file icon on the taskbar in 7. Worked fine in the other versions.\n\nAnother praise for Windows 7 is that it is stable and secure. I don't know why people talk about such matters; my XP and Vista computers are all plenty stable and secure. And just now, Windows 7 froze on the PBS online game my son is playing. So it's not like Windows 7 freezes less often.\n\nI don't recommend Windows 7 if you already have Vista and is looking for something exciting in the new OS. They are the same. They even look the same. Otherwise; get either 7 or Vista; no need to get both, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nI am getting rid of Windows 7 and putting XP back. I wonder if Microsoft will ever coming up with a new fancy OS again, or is this the best Windows is going to get?

That's good, but it can also be bad if you can't make them work. You have to enter your activation code the first time you run the program. Also, when you first run the program the \"What do you want to do?\" wizard is displayed. The wizard has a learning section which includes videos to demonstrate how a number of the features are used. The speakers have a British accent and can be a little hard to understand at times. You can't access any of the menus until you close the wizard. The initial display looks rather similar to Corel PaintShop Pro X2 / X3 if you're familiar with PaintShop.\n\nThere are some idiosyncrasies in Serif PhotoPlus X4. For example, if you choose the Save As command, the file types that you can choose from are only PhotoPlus' Spp format and the jpg format. If you want to save as another file format or if you want to use the optimizer to control picture size and quality, you have to use the Export command. Another example is the adjustments gallery on the right side of the workspace. This gallery shows a number of adjustments to choose from, like (color) levels, curves, color balance, brightness/contrast, hue/saturation, channel mixer, gradient map, lens filter, etc. However, once you select one of these options and make an adjustment, you probably won't be able to see how to return to the adjustments menu. The reason is that the back button to return to the adjustments gallery is hidden. You'll have to drag the bottom border of the adjustments box down so that the back button is displayed. I prefer the way that Google's Picasa gives you adjustment options on the Effects menu because you can see a small image to preview what the adjustment might look like before you choose it. That's not the case with the adjustments box where you have to first choose an option and then you see the effect. There is also a PhotoFix feature which is similar to the adjustments box. And PhotoPlus has a Filter Gallery which is similar to the Picasa Effects in that it does show an small image which gives a preview of what the filter does.\n\nThere are some powerful features in Serif PhotoPlus that you may like. The \"cut out\" feature for cutting objects out of a picture is excellent. The makeover feature is good for removing red eyes, whitening teeth, removing blemishes, etc. You can work with raw files. There are also macros available for the power user.\n\nAt times the program would not let me do the things that I thought should be easy to do. For example, I cut out two different images and I wanted to paste one as a new layer on the other, but the command to paste a new layer was grayed out. Another time I did an adjustment to a picture and then I wanted to use the Cut Out Studio, but the Cut Out Studio command was grayed out and I could not select it. Another time I opened a photo and the photo was not displayed.

I suggested at the time that the slowness might be ameliorated by having a supported NVidia or AMD video card that could enable the hardware acceleration.\n\nSo now I have version 10 and I do have an NVidia Fermi GTS450 card which significantly accelerates Adobe Photoshop and DxO Optics Pro.  But it seems to do nothing for PowerDirector, even when it lights up the checkboxes for hardware acceleration.  It took an hour and a half (!) to render a 20-minute video, while Pinnacle Studio was done in about 20 minutes. (Pinnacle Studio does not claim hardware acceleration.)\n\nSadly, the file size issue is also still with us - at what appears to be comparable quality settings, the MP4 and MOV files produced by PowerDirector 10 were 2-3 times the size of those from Pinnacle Studio.  Worse, this version fails to produce a watchable MOV at all - it consistently fails with an error at the end of the process, where version 9 did not.

I was able to create my own simple template, but I think that they went just a bit crazy with the bling.\n\nI did not try the 3D features - while the package includes a set of red-green glasses, the software claims to be able to create 3D movies that will play on 3D TVs that use polarizing or shutter glasses. Not having a 3D TV I could not test this.\n\nI really wanted to like CyberLink PowerDirector, but my inability to get it to produce a short video in a reasonable time and size, means that I'll pass it over in favor of Pinnacle Studio, which has never given me a problem.</td><td>01 22, 2012</td><td>A2NB2E5DXE319Z</td><td>S.

I have a few years of experience working with AutoCAD so this was relatively easy for me to dive into and experiment with, but if you're a new user, be forewarned you will need to educate yourself on it. AutoCAD is not a program you can just jump into and learn with some trial and error. Consider watching some online help videos and perhaps doing a little reading on it as well. I'd say at least 5-6 hours of research and learning would be ideal before you actually try it out.\n\nIf you're a longtime user of AutoCAD on the PC, you should be able to load this onto your Mac and get a feel for it with very few or no problems whatsoever. The program is full-featured and bursting with options. The 3D aspect works flawlessly from what I've seen. The only real downside here is the outrageous price. Some may mark it down for that aspect, but the way I view it is if you need this solution and you're comfortable paying a pretty penny for it, by all means go for it.

So you won't have to worry about your smartphone,ipod, or tablet being compatible. McAfee LiveSafe is similar to other versions of McAfee and comes with a built in Virus software to help you protect against Malware,Spyware and of course other Viruses that may infect your device. It also comes with a slimmed down version of a Firewall called \"Web Security\" which you can switch on and off at will, however in my experience it has never interfered with anything I am doing online unlike some other firewalls so i always keep it on for extra security.\n\nWhat is special about McAfee Live Safe is that it is a universal licensed product. Meaning that for 1 yr you can protect as many devices as you wish with only once purchase of the code. Unlike some protection software that only limit you to one or three uses you can use this on 10, 20, 30 devices if you wish.\n\nSo if you're looking for some extra safety look no further Mcafee has got you covered!</td><td>01 22, 2014</td><td>A12E0Y0J6584RT</td><td>Desiree</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC/Mac, null, null, null)</td><td>McAfee Safe for all your Gadgets</td><td>1390348800</td><td>false</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>B00EZPXVWU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The product is great, but when installing it over a previous version with fewer user licenses, and remaining time on its subscription, (my situation), the installation was very frustrating.

I would not suggest that you rely upon this extensive library of contracts and forms if you have absolutely no knowledge of the law, or no experience with legal issues. That being said it is a first-class tool to use at state and federal level. The program itself is extraordinarily easy to install. The user agreement in the installation process is mildly amusing since it disavows any liability and\nrecommends that you should consult a lawyer, and the extent of any liability for the company that puts out the legal business Pro software is just for the cost of the program. That piece of mild amusement (at least for anyone who has done contract law at university level) aside, the program provides updates as you start and continues, if you register, to provide additional updates for two years after 31st of December 2014; one of the bonuses of registration is a 404 page contract law book.\n  Once you start the program you have a whole list of resources including a library of legal books and even references to lawyers by category. When you start to create a document the program has a basic three-part interface: the first is create document. The second is read Nolo book from library. And the third is view checklist. A sizable amount of the forms that you can use are basically fill in the spaces type of documents, and for small businesses these will undoubtedly come in handy; about the only recommendation I would make is that wherever possible make sure that you have very good records, since (for example) a request for a bounced check to be honored, could quickly get to a small claims issue, and how something as simple as that is handled varies from state to state. The second reference to the library is probably going to be good for research for contracts, and finding cases with precedents where certain clauses are deemed enforceable, and certain closely worded ones are deemed not enforceable can usually be found in either case law or precedent books. In the more basic sense, the checklist in legal business Pro can help you through some easy things to sort out, as well as some moderately complex things to sort out. As good as this set of forms, contracts, and other references are in the legal realm, the biggest issue you will face, in my opinion, is the decision concerning when your own ability to handle issues is stretched to its limits, and it's time to call a lawyer. Still, it may be a big learning experience if you draft up a contract, whether agreement, lease, business related contract, and take it to a lawyer and see how far off the mark you might be. If you are halfway decent at researching you might actually find that you can draw up a contract that actually stands up to the test, and legal business Pro 2014 is definitely the set of tools to get you at least part of the way there.</td><td>01 22, 2014</td><td>A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</td><td>Santeria</td><td>List(null,  CD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Excellent guide and reference for legal tools</td><td>1390348800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00F8K9MZQ</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am very delighted about this software.

For example, I was unable to find effective tax rate paid in any report, nor did I find several years of historical tax data.

Instead, these loyal customers get a healthy punch to the abdomen.

I, for one, can't wrap my mind around any sort of justification.\n\nIntuit has always made great products, nothing has changed in this regard.

I have used Nero ever since as I watched it get bloated with more and more \"features\" that had little or nothing to do with CD/DVD burning.  Nero is truly several separate applications rather than a suite, and the CD/DVD burning portion is capable but very dated.  My new computer came pre-loaded with Roxio Creator 9 so I have been using it for several months and had no problems with it.  I liked some of the new features of Creator 10 when it was introduced but was completely scared away by all of the negative, and even hostile, reviews.  Recently I was able to buy it for 39 after rebates and figured I couldn't go wrong for the price.  After using it for a while here are my first impressions:\n\nThe variety and usefulness of the included applications is amazing.  Even at full price I think it is one of the best software bargains in the world.  I have tried each of the apps, though not in depth, at this point and they each work.  My favorite is the audio capture function.  Unlike everything else out there that requires several steps to capture audio, Creator 10 installs a widget on your screen in which you simple press a red \"record\" button to capture a clip.  After the capture is completed you are taken to a very easy to use audio editing screen where you can trim and equalize your clip before saving it to a variety of popular formats.  This application alone is worth the price of the entire bundle.\nAlso included are a competent backup program, nice media player (but come on, who needs another media player with Microsoft, Apple and Real dominating the market?), label creator, media manager (a cool app that catalogs all those unlabeled CD/SVD disks you have laying around), apps to easily create music and video compilations, a nice photo editing app plus a panorama photo stitcher, a pretty capable video editing program (although I'm puzzled why it can't read FLV files), a cassette/LP converter tool, and about 10 more highly useful tools.\n\nNegatives?  Well first of all I will semi-dispute what several reviewers have said about it freezing their system on installation.  I thought so too, and then realized that a full install was loading over 50,000 files into my computer and even though I have a very powerful computer, the process took almost 45 minutes, making it the longest load time for any software I've ever owned.  Where Roxio messed up is that the install screen only has a simple message that \"installation may take several minutes\".  There are long periods ... like a couple of minutes at a time ... where the status bar does nothing and you would swear your computer is frozen.  You just have to have a lot of patience and resist the urge to terminate the install, which may be why some people have had so much trouble with the software.  Roxio could save a lot of frustration by making the install process a little more clear.\nMy other concern is that my anti-virus and anti-spyware programs (from two different companies) both identified Creator 10 as mal-ware.  I would like to know more about what information Roxio is gathering from my computer and how they are using it.  Software companies should be more open with their customers about such things.\n\nBottom line is that I don't think Creator 10 is as bad as some people make it out to be.  Today's computers are incredibly complex and there seems to be a tendency to blame hardware or software for lack of understanding of how computers work.  Other than your operating system, Creator 10 is probably one of the most complicated things you can install on your computer and there is no doubt it will have a noticeable effect on performance.  If you choose to go with Creator 10 make sure you have a very capable system with plenty of hard drive space and as much memory as you can afford.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I think overall the positives outweigh the negatives.</td><td>01 23, 2008</td><td>A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ</td><td>PhotoGraphics</td><td>List(null,  CD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A ton of bang for the buck</td><td>1201046400</td><td>false</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>B000W3RSGE</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have been a Beta Tester for Turbo Tax for several years.

So needless to say, I was VERY hesitant about upgrading to Quicken 2009.\n\nWhen it comes to the world of personal finance software, we as the general public have very limited choices.  I've used Quicken since the DOS days and moved over to Money, then back to Quicken.  My most recent version was 2006.  I booted it up and it told me it was time to upgrade because they will stop supporting online downloads come 4/30/09.  Initially I was pretty hacked off...like a lot of others here.  Then I took a deep breath, and did the math.  I think my Deluxe version cost me about $20 somewhere (eBay perhaps??) so let's do the math together shall we?  $20/3 years is about $6.67 a year.  Holy Break The Bank Batman!!  Seriously people. Quit griping.  How about you not drink 2 Starbucks all year long and put it in your \"Upgrade Quicken\" jar.\n\nThis upgrade cost me $39 direct from Quicken and took 17 minutes to download.  So let's do the math for the next 3 years, shall we? $39/3 years is a wallet busting $13 a year!!  Skip your $5 footlong at Subway 3 times all year long and you can afford the upgrade...amazing isn't it?\n\nThe upgrade was flawless on my XP machine.  Double-clicked the start-up icon and away we went.  It found my previous version and un-installed it, installed the new version and ran for the first time.  It immediately found an update so I accepted it.  After the update, the program opened to the main screen.  All of my files imported flawlessly and I was downloading my newest transactions immediately thereafter.\n\nOne of the best improvements is how you can copy digital images into the register.  In my old version, I had to save the file to my desktop and then add it through a few clicks.

There was only one year (about 7 or 8 years ago) that I used something else because TaxCut was terrible. All the other years, it has been the best.\n\nA few years I had to use accountants because of the complexity of my taxes for those years. After the number of obvious mistakes that they made, I went back to doing it myself. I got tired real quick of having to pay a lot for my taxes to be done wrong and have them delivered to me on April 13.\n\nAlthough complete, there are a few (rare) forms missing and it would help if there was more information on-line and in the program. It is kind of awkward to have to go running off to the IRS site for a small but important piece of information. The program and the IRS are a little overeager to charge the AMT, even after the first time that it checks and says that I don't need to pay it. Also, there is something about my returns that makes the IRS want me to pay in advance quarterly, even though almost all of my income is only salary--not investments, etc.\n\nThey are making a lot of progress on the state versions. The first few years, I had to do half of the state forms myself. They have improved this every year and now it is as easy as the Federal version, even though state laws don't match up exactly with the federal version.\n\nThe error checking and other features of this program are really helpful, too. This year the e-mailing is included (it's about time!), although you can still file the paper forms or the reduced paper forms. You can always get a copy of your return or one form on paper--even halfway through the process, if you need it.\n\nI have never had to use their call-in service because of the completeness of the program.\n\nThey have a service that will send you the next year's program on DVD so that you can start it and pay them online for it. I got that and then found out that Amazon's price was $5.00 less and I received it in two days.\n\nAs an aside, I am not real impressed that the same thing happened to TaxCut that has happened to a lot of companies lately.

Expert users obviously don't want to pay more on a product to cover the development time required to create and maintain really good tutorial modes. It's just really important that you understand that there's not a lot of guidance within the program about what you're doing. I had to look at books that were written to teach CAD programs.\n\nInstallation was no big deal for me. It took a little while, but there were no mishaps (on a W7 64bit computer with an i5 processor).

If you already know what you're doing, the most useful thing I can tell you is that the software has been reliable and has done what it's supposed to do.

I truly have never had much of a preference for any of them, though I certainly do not count myself as a power user, nor someone who has a lot of unsafe browsing habits.\n\nAmong the features that Kaspersky boasts are the usual firewall, antivirus and website protection, anti pop-up software, parental controls,  and more unique items like a protected virtual keyboard and Safe Money for protecting financial transactions and vulnerability scans which check third party programs for possible vulnerabilities.\n\nSo far Ive found that the suite seems to work effectively.  A few things Ive noticed:\n\n * Kaspersky is not a resource hog.  Unlike some programs like Norton, Kaspersky seems to be pretty frugal.  Thats a good thing for those of us who use our computers for things like high end gaming.\n\n* The secure virtual keyboard feature is sort of a clever idea. It helps to protect you from keyloggers by using a protected virtual keyboard to allow you to input sensitive information such as passwords and the like.\n\n* The Network monitor feature seems to be a lot easier to use than other softwares. It breaks down what ports are open and what is using them in an easy to understand way. Some of the other softwares Ive used in the past haven't been quite as elegantly presented.\n\n* Unlike some users here, I did not find any compatibility issues with Safe Money or any of the other web features of Kaspersky. Safe money is a feature that seems to be unique to Kaspersky. The program opens a new protected browser instance when you go to websites at which you might spend or interact with money, such as banks, shopping websites, etc.\n\n* One thing that is negative is that sometimes when performing a full scan, the computer locks up if you try to do other tasks at the same time.  My set up has been rock stable before Kaspersky, so theres no doubt in my mind that KAspersky is the culprit. This to me is a BIG negative.\n\nOverall, I have found Kaspersky to be a fairly good piece of software. Aside from the crashing complaint, which only seems to rarely happen during full scans, this software is at least as good as any of its competitors.</td><td>01 23, 2014</td><td>A11JU33HMT5XPU</td><td>S.

In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.  Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!)  This game will take you many hours to complete.  For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from \"The Secret of the Old Clock\", with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.  Also, if after you've installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL.  If you're using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on \"Display\", then clicking on the \"Settings\" tab, then clicking the \"Advanced...\" button, then clicking the \"Performance\" tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to \"Full.\"  Then you'll need to restart you computer.  This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!  All in all, this is a very fun game for teenage girls and young women (and hey, guys too!), great for friends and family members to play together, and just an all-in-all wonderful game.

HOWEVER, I have a few more concerns.  I loaded it onto my computer to check it out.  I didn't like what I saw so I unloaded it.  Out of curiosity, I loaded it again.  It behaved as if I had never unloaded it the first time.  My alloted number of uses (before activation) decreased so something is still in there saying it was on there before (yes, yes, yes...in the registry).  Ok, Bill wants a new mansion so he is trying to prevent piracy.  I can understand that.  HOWEVER, my next concern is realllllyyy big.  In ME, you can set a restore point.  This restore point allows you to reconfigure your PC to a point from the past.  This is present just in case a new program you load has some problems, etc....  Now remember, ME is Mr. Gate's program just like Publisher.  I had to reformat my hard drive (thanks to Microsoft's Encarta Reference Library).  My system was fresh as a daisy.  I re-loaded Publisher out of curiosity to see what would happen.  I created a restore point PRIOR to loading it.  I didn't activate it because I didn't want it.  I unloaded it.  Just to test the system, I used my restore function.  If you are following me carefully, you can tell I have already made two changes since creating the restore point:  loading and unloading Publisher.  Guess What!?!  ME wouldn't allow the restoration because NOTHING HAD CHANGED ON MY PC!  HELLO???  I loaded and unloaded a program; I consider that a change.  Let's say Publisher had a problem and didn't work.  In order to get it off my PC, I would have to do ANOTHER format for my hard drive.  That, my friends, is scary.  And to add on to another person's review.  That person was incorrect when he/she said you could only have it on two PC's and would be out of luck if one crashed.  You can get it activated again and give some excuse as to why it needs to be reactivated (at least, that's what the support person told me).  But who wants to go through that every single time you want to load this program???  I know piracy exists but I don't see Microsoft in any financial distress.  I find it degrading that its customers have to do such a time-consuming procedure for a program which retails for $...  $..??  Maybe.  But $...??  That's pretty sad.  If you have it, stick with Publisher '98.  You can load it and not have to call Microsoft every time you need to install it.

One cannot upgrade willy nilly from any version of Windows to any version of Windows 7. Then, I used Windows Easy Transfer to migrate my data to an external hard drive.

I know, I should have done it all at once.\n\nThe first clean install was flawless. The second clean install was fraught with problems. Windows would not let me repair nor do a clean install. \"On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks.\" Lots of googling to solve this problem, and I did not find anything like what I finally did: I went to the \"advanced\" screen of the Windows setup screen and deleted all the partitions.

If forced to do it, I was convinced it would not be for a long time. I was very happy with Windows 7, as I was XP Pro in former years. My plan was to upgrade from Win 7 Home Premium to Ultimate and, with the added features and security, stay there as long as possible. But, actually I found that to get there was more getting improbable than I imagined, or just unfeasible. I had waited too long to do those Win 7 upgrades. Microsoft was no longer offering them. There were no bargains left. With what looked like bargains, I was seeing too many people getting burned with counterfeit copies of software. The software available that was legit, priced itself out of reach (yes, the unfeasible part).\n\nThen, I saw this option. With some promotional credits I could use, and the list price of this upgrade, the cost would be insignificant. Most of the reviews I read here helped me to overcome the last vestiges of the stigma I saw attached to Windows 8. The free upgrade to 8.1 was helpful because that's where I wanted to go and make my computers have the look and feel of Win 7. It worked!\n\nIt was quick, pretty straight-forward, and included the entire migration of programs, features, and files from Windows 7 to Windows 8.\n\nThe initial download took less than 20 minutes, building an ISO file (which I didn't use) another 10, and the shortcut (mentioned below in the reviews) of first downloading and installing only the \"kb2871389\" update, permitted me to move right to the 8.1 upgrade. Once there, the 8.1 upgrade and the other updates took some time. I finally downloaded \"Classic Shell,\" which was the last step necessary to give the look and feel of Windows 7.\n\nI highly recommend this. I believe that this will give lasting life to my desktops. This is a stable operating system. You won't notice much of a difference at all.

Mac version is not user-friendly and difficult to use, installation is very tortuous, takes a long time, and instead of starting with your previous version 4.0 profile, prompts you to start all over again with a new profile. And then program repeatedly hangs up and freezes.

Just as well, because it was a more or less positive review and now, even though I have fibromyalgia and typing hurts, I'd rather be in pain than use Dragon Naturally Speaking.  First of all, while it will run on all but the oldest computers, it slows everything way down.  Try running it while you've got anti-virus software running and the lag time after you dictate is really annoying, especially when you realize it's garbled what you said quite badly, or made strange choices among homophones.  It has a particularly bad time with a standard American accent. It does much better if you speak with an exaggerated New York accent (think Mike Meyers doing \"Coffee Talk\" on SNL).  Otherwise, if you pronounce \"dawn\" and \"Don\" the same, it will choose Don everytime, even if the context doesn't make sense.  It's probably great for dictating things like book reports using simple, common words and not too many names or capitalized terms, but if you are dictating something complex or with a lot of specialized terms or abbreviations, or defined terms that are capitalized, it leaves a lot to be desired.  And you've got to get it right the first time, because moving around within a document to edit is downright irritating, especially if you want to correct a word that appears multiple times.  It's supposed to get better the longer you use the program and the more it gets \"trained,\" but honestly it just gets worse.  The program also has an annoying habit of thinking ordinary dictation is a command word and opening up a pull-down menu when you least expect or want it to.\n\nIf you really can't type, it's better than nothing, but unless you also use a headset for voice over internet applications, you'll probably want to get a desktop microphone for use with this -- the headset that comes with the software isn't comfortable for extended periods of time and the standard software doesn't work with BlueTooth headsets.  I haven't used this program in a really long time.  It's just too frustrating, so unless I am writing something really long, I'd rather hurt a little.

None of it is confusing, but there are a lot of options.  The software operates simply, though.  It doesn't throw numerous alerts at you every time you do something on the PC.  It knows which new programs to trust (whitelisting?) and allows them access through the firewall.  I haven't had a problem with malware on this machine.  It seems to be doing just fine.\n\nIn all, this is a worthy contender.  I rate it right up there with Kaspersky 2010, my other favorite suite at the moment.

That did not get included in my e-file.  If I am paying extra (a lot extra) to e-file another state, why would they not include ALL the forms that are required?  I have pointed that out to Intuit.  I don't plan to do that again.\n\nThe program imports a lot of info which saves time.\n\nAll in all I am pleased.  I haven't finalized things yet, just did what I could, but so far it is pretty typical.  I knocked off stars because of the up-selling.  I was all set to buy the Deluxe and discovered that it no longer did what it did last year.  And then I recalled how I had during the course of using it last year had to upgrade anyway for some financial importing features that actually saved me time to do and ended up being worth the extra money.\n\nDon't expect a lot of customer support from them and don't pay attention to their guarantees.  Had an issue one year when they miscalculated and I had to pay interest.  To get the guarantee refund, etc., they wanted me to go through so many hoops that would have taken so much time it wasn't worth it.  I essentially had to recreate the file.  They would not accept their own electronic file I had on my computer.  Go figure.  Made no sense.\n\nBut, overall I have been pleased with them.  Like I said, I knocked off stars for their come from behind change in product and up-selling.</td><td>01 25, 2015</td><td>A11T807LX2EF00</td><td>Michael</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC/Mac Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Good product.

Until then, I had not been too familiar with the application, but was blown away with its performance. I soon replaced McAfee and Trend Micro on all my work PCs with Kaspersky and have been very happy ever since. Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2011 has continued this performance.\n\nWhy do I think it is the best anti-virus software? Well, I judge mostly on performance. I must be honest and say that I have never had a virus or worm, etc. on any of my computers; so, I cannot talk much to how well this or any other anti-virus catches incoming threats. Other than flagging the occasional virus in an email attachment, I have no experience with dealing with serious threats.\n\nSo performance... In the olden days, there was Norton; and, Norton was good - briefly. Then it became a resource hog and seemed to want to take over the computer and its processing power. Luckily, better and faster and less intrusive options like McAfee and Trend Micro came along; but, even these started to become a little burdensome after a while. Then, enter Kaspersky. Kaspersky runs quietly in the background, doesn't hog the processor, and doesn't try to take over my computer. The other aspect I rate under performance is updating... Kaspersky updates almost daily, and does it well in the background without taxing the computer. That was an issue that came along with Trend Micro - both its initial scan and updating upon booting up the computer, it held up Windows from fully loading until it was done... often up to five minutes!\n\nKaspersky is the only anti-virus I use on all my computers at home and at the office.</td><td>01 26, 2011</td><td>A1RIQUDE4B8NGX</td><td>Wildness</td><td>null</td><td>The current leader in virus protection in my book.</td><td>1296000000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B005AAWNBE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Being someone who has a basic knowledge of computers and how they work I was skeptical on whether I could install this myself or if I would need help.

The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.\n\nI will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).\n\nAll of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.\n\nI don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.\n\nAlso, none of the forms were usable \"as-is\" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).\n\nNonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.</td><td>01 26, 2012</td><td>A1HOLE9R6WPT85</td><td>Mad Max</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Really for individuals & small business ...

No more hunting through endless menus trying to find commands. They really did a good job of streamlining the user interface and making it easy to jump in and get started.\n\nMy only complaint is that the program can sometimes be a little slow, even on my i7 system, and if you are not careful it is easy to lose your work.

Had to get a new Federal Pin no. online and refile the entire thing again. The second filing was accepted but I had to jump through hoops with the process simply because the programs instructions were frequently erroneous, misleading or went nowhere causing a LOT of retracing and reentering of data and re-reading of instructions that I had to eventually print out because of the circles that I was lead in while attempting to get the process to work. The entire process took me about 2 1/2 hours to get a successful resubmission.\n\nI am using this software this year because of the bad changes in Turbo-Tax Deluxe for this year which ticked me off no end!. However, I see where TT has acknowledged their mistakes and is offering free fixes and a promise to restore everything that they messed up to tick so many people off. If this proves to be viable, I may return to TT next year simply because of it's straightforward  and easy to understand simplicity.

It requires activation, but that's the least of its sins.  Scanning is slow, and it misses lots of trojans and worms.  It also takes up a huge chunk of RAM, and occasionally can crash, esp. doing live update.  Speaking of which, the product installs lots of useless programs without your permission.

You do need a DVD drive to use it (three of our home computers don't have a DVD drive). You also need a mouse, that's all you need.\n\nThis is a fun program in which you manipulate the mouse to make art. Since I own and use Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 I note some of the controls are quite similar such as selecting the tool and opacity and working with layers.\n\nTo start, you just click on the type of medium you want to use (i.e. marker, pencil, paintbrush) then select the thickness, color, and opacity and you are off and running. The menu bar is in the corner and you can expand some of them if you find that easier.\n\nI started fooling around with this without directions, since none came in a paper form and I'm a book person. However there are tutorial documents on the disc to help you. On a whim I used an internet search engine and found video tutorials from the manufacturer on YouTube. These helped me the most.\n\nI am an amateur artist and enjoy this program. I let my kids test it out, they are aged 10 and 13 and both found it simple. They used the tools intuitively and found more features than I realized existed. They really liked the split screen mirror image tool and the one that repeats in the four quadrants what you do on the screen (imagine drawing with one line but seeing an image like a kaleidoscope).\n\nSince I am new to making digital art, I realize there's a learning curve. While I can control a regular drawing pencil in my hand to sketch on paper, it's a completely different skill to use the mouse to replicate the same thing. It's an odd feeling to try to do something you know you can do with pencil and paper but struggle to make a smooth or straight line with the mouse as the tool. In the beginning it feels like a trick on the mind to use a mouse and see the medium you usually associate with a regular marker, paintbrush, or pencil making magic on the screen.\n\nI have no compaints about this product.\n\nAs with any computer program or with any traditional art medium, what you get out of it depends both on what you want to do with it (translating your concept to reality) and also how much time you put into learning the skills, procedures and techniques necessary to get it to do what you want it to do.

These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line.\"\n\nIn essence, \"we did this to avoid confusion and help us be more innovative.\"\n\nRight.</td><td>01 27, 2015</td><td>A10ZFE6YE0UHW8</td><td>C.

I've added a star (now at three).  If I was to rate how Turbo worked well for me for many years, I would have given it 4 to 5 stars.  I never had a very complicated filing so others might rate differently.  I rated it 2 to 3 stars now because they've let me down this year.  There is plenty of chaos in the world, so I am happy when there is stability and reliability in something, especially MY MONEY!  I've switched to H&R Block.\n\nOver time, Turbo has gradually ratcheted up their price which I could have lived with.  Instead of paying the usual $50 (everywhere you look) for Deluxe, I would wait until about now and buy at a Club store or on Amazon if there was a deal for about $40.\n\nAs I read about the changes this year, I got concerned.  I don't think I would really have a problem with this year's version, but what if I did!  I think H&R Block saw an opening and I bought it for about $16 from Amazon.  Why not try it this year?  I see that Turbo has \"backtracked\" on the extra charges.  But, it's too late for me.  Who wants the extra aggravation trying to get your money back?  If H&R works ok for me this year, I won't be returning to Turbo unless they're giving it away!\n\nTurbo is made by Intuit, the SAME company that makes Quicken.  Intuit means \"understand or work out by instinct\".  This is not always the case with either Turbo or Quicken.  Like Turbo, I used Quicken for many, many years.  Every year, they'd come out with a new version, apparently just to generate revenue.  They would totally change the GUI (kind of like what Turbo does).  They would introduce so many errors that it would take the rest of the year to fix them.  Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and simply use my bank's \"on-line banking\" function which is free, saving me $10 a month AND the cost of the yearly upgrade.\n\nAt least Turbo doesn't seem very buggy.  However, they do do \"dumb\" things, like always printing Estimated Tax forms for the next year.  They're never correct because Turbo doesn't know about other income I may have the following year.  But, okay.  I just throw away 4 sheets of paper.  I also don't like having to clear a screen every time I start where they want to know if I want to buy more Turbo service.\n\nI think this is serious for Turbo.  All of the sharks, like H&R, are going to be looking for a way to get a larger share of the tax market.  This could be good for us by driving down prices.</td><td>01 27, 2015</td><td>A2L46U9X378VKP</td><td>G.

In fact, I feel that it could have been better in so many ways.  Don't get me wrong.  The Nancy Drew games series is great.  In each game, you, as Nancy Drew, gather clues, interview people, solve puzzles, explore secret passages, and find the culprits.  The games are engaging, fun, and even educational.  And they're fun for both kids and adults alike.  The first game in the series, \"Secrets Can Kill,\" was well-intentioned but the character graphics (and the fact that you had to switch back and forth between two CDs) left much to be desired.  However, after \"Secrets,\" the games began to significantly improve.  You would think, then, that by the seventh game, the games would be stellar.  Not true.  I think they peaked at game three (\"Message in a Haunted Mansion\") and four (\"Treasure in a Royal Tower\").  It's almost as if, by game seven, the designers/creators have run out of ideas.  I don't mean for the plots -- I mean for puzzles, for character's wisecracks, that sort of thing.  Things that move the game along and make it fun.  Most every puzzle in \"Ghost Dogs\" was eerily similar to a puzzle we've seen in a previous Nancy Drew game, the only exception being the one you have to play when Nancy is in peril toward the middle of the game (this is not a spoiler; in just about every Nancy Drew game, Nancy is in peril about halfway through the game.)  That puzzle was fun.  But the others could have been better.  Also, in each Nancy Drew game there is some sort of educational element.  You learn things as you go along, from books, computers, newspaper articles, or signs.  But in this game, there was a HUGE amount of information on parks on one single computer.  Most of this information wasn't even important to the game.  Why is it there?  Who's going to sit there and read it?  With all due respect, I was just slightly bored with \"Ghost Dogs.\"  My last complaint (and I really don't mean to sound like a picky grouch; I love Nancy Drew, really, I do) is Nancy's personal data assistant that she carries with her now.  She puts all her clues in there.  She even carries maps around with her now!  One of the most fun things about the Nancy Drew games, for me, has been that you have to write down clues (on paper, in real life), trace maps, etc.  If I happen to not notice a clue in \"Ghost Dogs,\" well hey, Nancy (but I thought *I* was Nancy?) has already jotted it down for me.  And this was on the senior level!  I guess I could just NOT look at the PDA, but come on, it's too tempting.  Where's the challenge?  I really hope the next game will be better; from the promo, it looks very intriguing.  And I *do* have faith in the designers to make this next one a winner.  In conclusion, me just say this: if you've never played a Nancy Drew game before, you'd be safe to start with this one, since all the puzzle concepts would be new to you.  But it's not the best.  Still, if you're a Nancy Drew fan, it's still pretty amusing and so I give it 4 stars.</td><td>01 28, 2003</td><td>A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2</td><td>Molly P.</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Not the best Nancy Drew game there is</td><td>1043712000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B000W3T6NM</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>Please read the UPDATE following the initial review.\n\n1/28/08:  I'm using Turbo Tax \"Premiere\".

I had installed this on three different Operating Systems: two running Windows 7 and one running Windows XP. The first Windows 7 installation did encounter some problems but I was able to let it do a scan of my computer and then re-installed and it worked fine. The Windows XP one had the 2009 version on it and it went very fast without any problems. I had found that after installing 2010 on the Windows XP, that I had a lot less bugs than before. However, since my computer was just bogged down with too much applications and files on it, I did a new install of Windows 7. With the newest Windows 7, I installed 2010 and again, no problems whatsoever. It was smooth and ran very fast. In fact, I barely notice the antivirus running.\n\nThe backup is very easy to setup. Just note that the online backup is only for a limited amount of time. I believe it is for one year. All of the other features work great and the new look is so much better than before.

Hence, my review has changed from 3 stars to 4 stars.\n\nAfter speaking to the Director of (FMS) Customer Care, who took the time to reach out to me personally, it is my opinion that customer service and brand reputation is very important to intuit. It is unfortunate that the problem occurred at multiple points of contact but intuit is working to correct their customer's experiences. Time will tell if they can get it cleaned up. As a note: there was no time whatsoever that intuit asked me to change my review. This add-on is my choice because I feel intuit wants to do a better job and is willing to listen to customers to improve their experience.\n\nAdditionally, I was told that in most cases QuickBooks 2007 would work on Windows 7 (too late for me though).\n\nWhat they really need to do is to get all points of customer contact on the same page and stop over selling add-ons and support programs.\n\n*************************************\nOriginal review: I've been using intuit products for 15 years and I am truly fed up with them.\n\nI was previously using QuickBooks 2007 but when I purchased a new computer running Windows 7, 64 bit I was told by intuit that QuickBooks 2007 would eventually corrupt my file if I ran it on Windows 7. Microsoft's website showing compatible software had it listed as not having any problems but who wants to mess with their accounting files. So, even though it seemed like a scam by intuit to make you upgrade, I purchased the product. Inuit sales told me on the phone that to get customer support, I needed to buy it directly from them and not a reseller like Staples or Amazon. I told them that was BS and purchased it elsewhere.\n\nAfter installation, I had to call to get my validation code and was told that I needed to give them a credit card number. \"For what?\" I asked. I already purchased the product (which by the way is annoying to have to purchase full versions every time instead of getting a break for being a current user...). I was told that to get \"complimentary\" 30 day technical support for installation issues I had to provide a credit card number that would go on file. Basically, intuit wants your number so that if YOU DO NOT CALL after the 30 days, they AUTOMATICALLY enroll you in their ongoing technical support program. If you choose not to conform, then you forfeit ALL TECHNICAL SUPPORT immediately. If I was to call back in 10 minutes and say that I just installed the program and was having trouble transferring data, I would be charged for the call. I told them it was ridiculous to make customers conform to their new support plans and that their 'complimentary' tech support was a given for most valid software companies without having to provide a credit card number. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place!!! I was not about to try to argue it out with technical support if I had the need to call so I relented (with a lot of harsh words to the 'supervisor' who would also not budge. I did not give a credit card number but a bank routing number. I happen to know that doing a bank transaction at my credit union is a difficult thing so it would be fairly safe that they would not be able to get anywhere. I also made it very clear that I did not want to have to call back to opt out of their ongoing tech support plan. It was the most frustrating software validation ever.\n\nI received some documents in the mail thanking me for joining their program (not an invoice though). I made sure to call again in 30 days and was happy to find out that my account had been automatically canceled within the 30 day 'complimentary' time frame. So at least someone followed through on their end. I hope I scared them enough to make sure it was done.\n\nThe part that bothers me most is that to get my software to run and keep the option of calling tech support during installation, I had to divulge financial details to float around in a possibly unsecure computer in the hopes that no one hacked into it and stole our data.\n\nI like the program. It is easy for me to use to manage my small business. I have not seen any noticeable differences in this edition compared to 2007 but I don't do payroll and some of the other things that may have changed.\n\nI also use Turbo Tax and Quicken and it just seems that intuit is constantly adding more and more fees to things that were originally part of using the software. I hate greedy companies. I don't have a problem with any company making money but considering that we HAVE to update (full version) on a regular basis since they stop providing validation codes for older versions they already have a captive audience. Stop taking advantage of your customers intuit!</td><td>01 28, 2010</td><td>A1EVV74UQYVKRY</td><td>K.

The fact that Corel issues different packs, some with a user manual and some without is something that some customers are upset about.\n\nI own and older edition of Photoshop Elements (a less expensive pared down version of the professional Photoshop) and am used to PS Elements. I will note that PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is the same pricing as PS Elements and from what I have been able to figure out, the two programs are very similar in content as well.\n\nBefore I tell why I am dissatisfied I'll share my opinion that if you already have a photo editing program, you probably should stick with that product and buy updates as you feel are necessary. There is a large and painful learning curve when moving from one software to another. I just learned this the hard way. The terms are different, the process is different, and it's just too painful to put oneself through unnecessarily. I am asking myself why I bothered to want to try PaintShop Photo Pro X3 when I was happy with (my no longer latest version of) Photoshop Elements. I guess I was thinking maybe this was better and why not get this and stop using PSE? I'm sorry I wasted my time. Before I say why I don't like this program I'll give more info.\n\nI am looking for very basic photo editing tools. I take photos with a DSLR but am more into the actual taking of well composed and well lit photographs than I am into spending hours of my time editing shots.  What I want photo editing for are some simple things such as: cropping photos, resizing photo files to make them smaller when necessary (i.e. submitting photos to newspapers and websites), to remove red eye, to make a soft edge on a photo and perhaps to adjust an overexposed or underexposed photo.\n\nRegarding projects, which this software does, I'm honestly not sure how I would use this. When making a photo book I would make it right on the site that professionally prints the book. When I make a photo Christmas card I make the soft edge on the photo right on the warehouse store website.  When I make a photo calendar I used the warehouse store's website to create it from home on the internet, and they print it and I pick it up at the store.\n\nI have a six month old computer PC: Windows 7 Premium and an i3 processor. It is not yet clogged up with too many files and had plenty of room on it for new programs. Installation was easy and took me about 90 minutes only because I would walk away and realize there were many steps and it was waiting for me to keep clicking more boxes.  I was confused though, over having to install multiple programs all from the same CDROM, and was unclear what the differences were between: Paintshop Photo Pro X3, Project Creator, Painter Essentials 4 and KPT collection (that one I did not even bother installing). I did the registration online; there were no phone numbers for me to call. Some reviewers mentioned ads on the screen, I saw no ads. I have over 30,000 photo files on my hard drive at the time this was installed. I don't understand why other reviewers are saying it took hours to load this software given the number of images on their hard drive.\n\nThe instruction manual was promising offering 4 ways for new users to learn to use the system: the Corel guide, the Learning Center palette, the help system and web-based resources. Despite this seemingly wonderful array of options when it came down to figuring out how to do something as simple such as resize a photo to scale it down to 72 dpi I could not find the answer. I still can't figure out how to see if it saved the file as jpg or if it is saving it with some other format (i.e. raw, gif). I was annoyed that searches with common keywords such as `resize' turned up no results. I could not find any of this information in the user manual either.\n\nWhen working to edit a photo I was annoyed that multiple images I was not using were lined up at the bottom which it randomly pulled off my hard drive, it was distracting. I am used to working with a program where the only thing on your work surface is what you have chosen to work on right now. I found that I could adjust the viewing box to get larger that pushed those off the screen.\n\nThe absolute worst thing about this program which is why I am uninstalling it and giving up is ---- the program over-wrote my existing program to view photo files that were already on my hard drive. When I try to open a photo by clicking on the file on my hard drive, it opens in the Corel Instant Viewer which is a piece of garbage that first pauses for 2 seconds doing nothing while it loads, then it shows an image for 2 seconds in a pixelated blurry mess before sharpening up to view it. Moving to the next photo using the arrow, such as to view photos you took on a certain day, takes 4 seconds to load each photo and my eyes go crazy with the sharp to blurry to sharp to blurry images. I cannot stand this Corel Instant Viewer.  It is impossible to quickly click through the photos. My old software from the Canon camera would instantly load with no pause and it would immediately be in perfect focus. This thing that Corel has is ridiculous.\n\nAfter spending 4+ hours installing and trying to edit one photograph to just crop it to zoom in, reading the user manual and the online help, just trying to get one photo to convert to 72 dpi and jpg format, and not being able to figure it out, I give up on the program and am going back to Photoshop Elements. The simplest editing task should not be that difficult to figure out.\n\nAt at the very least a photo program on a brand new, high speed computer should not take 4 seconds to load one photo image and make us look at it for 2 seconds blurry first - there is no need for such madness.</td><td>01 28, 2012</td><td>A3SMR4HRFJARSC</td><td>ChristineMM</td><td>null</td><td>Instant Photo Viewer a Total Disaster and Reason Enough to Uninstall the Program Entirely</td><td>1327708800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B005S4Y8TM</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>Yes, what took me about half an hour last year from download, install and data entry is still not done after at least six times that long and I am ANGRY. I am trying to create 1099s, a simple programming function compared to the rest of the tax needs I am going to have as I prepare our full taxes and THE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK. 1099 and W-2 is now forced to be online and the system is horrible, doesn't work and each successful data entry takes at least three attempts. And then you aren't sure if it is successful because instead of freezing your computer, you get this message:\n\nHouston, we have a problem...\nLuckily, we're not in space. Rest assured, our programmers are on it.\n\nThat may work if you sign out, sign in and try that again.\nIf you see this again, please contact us so we can help.\n\nI am not amused. NASA wouldn't have ever gotten to the moon with TurboTax 2011 Software. They'd never gotten to the launchpad. Or the rocket built. We'd still think it was made of swiss cheese.\n\nThen, of course, when you go back and try again, your data is often correct--after all you just entered a four digit number! Why would that break a system?\n\nSo, yes, believe the reviews. I haven't even started the individual tax return and I am worried. I might be buying TaxAct or whatever I can find before this tax season is over because my trust level is kaput. I could do 1099s online at the IRS site or handwrite them, they are the easiest, simplest form I will deal with over the next few months. But I bought TurboTax to make it even easier. And if it can't handle these, well, I shudder and I worry.\n\nAnd if you are in the same boat as me and bought early before the reviews and WANT to try this anyway, well, the functionality is slightly better in Google Chrome over IE 8. Not much but at least I got a file to transfer on my sixth attempt on Chrome. So my names were imported from last year's file. Never mind that it said it didn't and then it transferred the file twice and now won't let me delete the duplicates without that lovely Houston message I shared above. I finally got one to delete after 8 attempts. I may not be so lucky with the rest of them.\n\nSo yes. Crap. Utter, useless crap. I want a refund but it is software so that's not possible since I've ripped open the box and loaded this simulation of a tax preparer.\n\nThis is my 9th year using TurboTax and by far the worst experience I have ever had with it. Phooey on Intuit.\n\nUPDATE on 1/31/12:\n\nAfter countless attempts at data entry in the online 1099/W2 Reporter system, I finally got my 8 1099s completed. It took me 6 hours of repeated attempts to get the data entered. Yes, I was foolish. I could have done it somewhere else in less than an hour. Then I read in another review here that there is a backend way to do the reports through the software.\n\nClick FILE in the upper left hand corner menu and select NEW TAX RETURN and the selection like previous years. For kicks and giggles I decided to do that after finally printing up and mailing the 1099s today, a few days past when I intended. The whole process took me 15 minutes, what it has done in previous years. Why did Turbo Tax not give us the outright option? Why did they release extremely flawed online software? (Even selecting a state doesn't work in the drop down boxes unless you hit a hard enter after selecting, otherwise it clears out the field when you move to the next one. Nevermind the inability to process submitted info, the forms can't even handle data entry such as 5 digit only zip codes, etc.)\n\nSo this is too little too late for me and for you, but perhaps someone will be saved the headache.\n\nAnd do save that return for the 1099/W2s in the software (the work around) because even though you save it, it doesn't not come up as an option for your ongoing working returns in the open file page. You have to browse for it on your computer--know where you saved it!--if you need to access it again.\n\nPure idiocy...</td><td>01 28, 2012</td><td>A2TS040W2FW5O</td><td>Heidi Anne Heiner</td><td>List(null,  CD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Once A Loyal Customer, Now an Irate One--Found a Work Around</td><td>1327708800</td><td>true</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>1413313701</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Super fast install in Windows 7.\nIncludes a small book called, \"Legal Companion\".

I am unable to duplicate their test setups, so I have to take their word on it.\n\n  My estimation of Kapersky Anti-Virus is based on ease of installation (no problems), ease of use (average - didn't need to read the instructions) and performance (slow and bulky,like most - but not all - the AV programs I've used).\n\n  So would I use it based on experience and, perhaps even more importantly, the reports of the independent testing labs?

While I am disappointed that there were so many bugs at the time of release, Apple seems to have the worst of it behind them.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have been a big Mac fan (not to be confused with the hamburger) for nearly a year. All Apple products have run smooth and installation has been effortless.... and then along comes Leopard. I am very surprised at the number of positive reviews after my recent experiences... my highlights and low-lights after 4 days.\n\n- Internet connectivity - I am \"dropped\" offline on regular occurrences. At first I thought it was our modem/router until I reset both of them only to still be offline. The only thing that worked... restarting my Mac. Maybe it is a coincidence but the this began happening the day I loaded Leopard.\n\n- Memory HOG! I am not sure where it *went* but I now have an additional 20 gigs of hard-drive that is being occupied!\n\n- Not so plug-and-play. I have a Logitech Harmony al-in-one remote ... it works with all previous versions of Mac o/s... but it will not recognize leopard during the set-up. I wonder how many other devices will have this problem?\n\n- Random freezing. Seriously, this is why we dumped our PC! We were looking for a more stable operating system. I wouldn't compare it to the nightmare that is known as Vista... but Windows XP has an edge over Leopard.\n\n- The added features are nice- Time Machine makes backing up a cinch..... but is it worth it? You also get a much clearer picture when you Ichat... too bad the internet connectivity problems reduce our ability to Ichat.\n\n  As a whole....I would like to remove Leopard and wait until a service pack comes out to reinstall it. My recommendation - Hold-off.</td><td>01 29, 2008</td><td>A18YMFFJW974QS</td><td>CKE</td><td>null</td><td>Back up to 5 stars</td><td>1201564800</td><td>true</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>B0014X5XEK</td><td>List(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lCnCveEpL._SY88.png, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GCY+dwtZL._SY88.png, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TCmO5NjJL._SY88.png)</td><td>5.0</td><td>There is no way that I could give the iLife suite anything but 5 stars.

I would probably pay upwards of $600 for the suite of programs, and it costs only [...].  Crazy.\n\nThe following review covers the new features added in iLife '09 that weren't in iLife '08.  There are a lot of new features, and I'll update my review after I spend time with each one.\n\niPhoto '09\nFACE RECOGNITION: My iPhoto library is relatively small at 14,000 photos, most of which feature friends and family.  Because I'm a bit OCD, with iPhoto '08, I took the time to label all the photos with the names of the people contained in each picture.  I did this by writing the person's name in the \"Key Words\" field of each photo.  For a variety of reasons, my iPhoto library is much more valuable and useful to me when they are properly labeled with people's names.  As such, I was intrigued by the face recognition feature of iPhoto '09.  After allowing iPhoto '09 to scan my library of photos for faces (which took about 3 hours), I spent a handful of hours training iPhoto to know what everyone's faces look like.  This process (if you know how to do it) is indeed easier than the old way (of me typing in people's names in the \"key words\" field under each photo).  The facial recognition is pretty good, or maybe very good.  The problem I've discovered is that facial recognition is never going to be perfect.  Indeed some of the best photos have friends or family with their backs turned to the camera, or whatever, so facial recognition doesn't notice them.  If I were to rely solely on the facial recognition in iPhoto '09, I would fail to properly label all my pictures ... I'd miss some really really good pictures.  Then, months later, when I'm looking for a photo with my friend Sam, I won't be able to find certain photos, because it was never properly labeled with his name.  Long story short, I won't be using the facial recognition feature.  Instead, I'm going to continue to mark all my photos with names in the \"key words\" field of each photo.  Note also, the facial recognition feature cannot find the face of my parents' Dalmatian dog.\n\nPRINTED BOOKS (MAPS FEATURE): the printed books that I've created with iPhoto '08 are amazing.  I've had several people say, \"I've gotta get a mac\" when they see the books I've made.  And, a few months ago, Apple announced that the pictures in the printed books are going to be even higher-res (haven't had a chance to print a book since the announcement), so the books should look even better now. A new feature in iPhoto '09 is the ability to add custom maps to your books.  For instance, I created a book with a map showing a travel line from NYC-Helsinki-Warsaw-Cracow-Budapest-Vienna-Prague.  The map looks awesome (see photo uploaded to amazon).  Printed books make the perfect gift or coffee table book.  (TIP: after you create the map, right-click on the map for additional advanced options (e.g., changing the connecting lines from _curved_ lines to _straight_ lines).  Criticism: while the large-scale maps (i.e., big city to big city to big city) look great, zoomed-in maps (i.e., of an individual city or town) have no detail.  (See the photo uploaded to amazon of my map of Warsaw, Poland).  Hopefully they'll fix this.\n\nGEOTAGGING: this feature is so cool and totally belongs within iPhoto.  Years from now, when all the cameras have GPS built inside, it is going to be so convenient to have this metadata attached to photos.  That being said, I cannot imaging spending the time to label my 14,000 photos that don't currently have that data.  I did buy the \"Amod AGL3080 GPS Data Logger,\" to carry with me on trips so that I can add GPS data to new pictures I take.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  Update: I've had a chance to manually geotag some pictures (e.g., this batch of photos is \"Warsaw, Poland\").  It's pretty easy to tag photos.  That being said, there's really nothing amazing about having geotagged photos.  Hopefully future iterations of iLife will make use of having geotagged photos and movies (e.g., smart slide shows or movies that automatically include maps that zoom into pictures, or something).\n\nGarageBand '09\nMUSIC LESSONS: this is the most exciting part of iLife '09 for me.  These lessons look _better than real lessons_.  Seriously, better than live lessons with a real human.  I started the guitar lessons a week ago, and I just love them.  I can do the lesson over and over, at my own pace.  Apple really slammed this one out of the park.  I can't wait until I get good enough to use one of the $5 artist lessons.  Note: there are 9 free introductory piano lessons, and 9 free introductory guitar lessons (the lessons feature an acoustic guitar, but they appear to be useful for learning both acoustic and electric guitar ... same principles).  Note: Garageband includes a tuner, so that you can tune your guitar via your mac's microphone.  Well, it sucks and is nearly useless. (I'm using my iMac's built-in microphone).  I'm glad I bought this tuner: Korg GA-30 Ultra Compact Guitar and Bass Tuner (it works for both my electric and acoustic guitar).\n\nI'll update the review when I've had a chance to use the 1-2 dozen new features that are important to me.</td><td>01 29, 2009</td><td>A39O4B6IUNYTT8</td><td>FroggyM</td><td>null</td><td>Great</td><td>1233187200</td><td>false</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>B0014X5XEK</td><td>List(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lCnCveEpL._SY88.png, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GCY+dwtZL._SY88.png, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TCmO5NjJL._SY88.png)</td><td>5.0</td><td>There is no way that I could give the iLife suite anything but 5 stars.

I understand that the auto saving over old photos and other 'convenience' features are there to promote ease of use, however, as someone who is a little more hands on that the average user of these products I am more annoyed by Photo Express than I am enamored of its convenience.  The bottom line is Photo Express is going to appeal more to people who want a product that does everything for them and thus makes it easy to use while Photoshop Elements is a lot more hands on and a little more complicated.  Both of these programs have their flaws and uses, but if I were to buy just one I would stick with Photo Shop Elements over Photo Express.</td><td>01 29, 2010</td><td>AYVM2DODURDLE</td><td>Veritas513</td><td>null</td><td>Competition for Adobe Photo Shop Elements?</td><td>1264723200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B002JB1TTO</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have used several different computer security products, and I found this one very easy to install, and minimally invasive.

For the most part I'm impressed with the content too, although the introductory level was frustrating at times.\n\nThe course provides a good introduction to the  CS5 user interface, the Flash tools, file types, and managing the timeline.  There's also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.\n\nAgain, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.). This is helpful if you want to view the videos and work hands-on on your computer, although the small screen would be difficult.  The DVD also includes a collection of asset files that correspond with the lessons.\n\nIf you are a visual learner or don't prefer thick technical books, then this video course would be a good low-cost alternative. Don't expect to be a Flash expert when you complete this course, but at least you'll understand the basic concepts.</td><td>01 29, 2011</td><td>A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9</td><td>Dave Edmiston</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Good Intro to Flash CS5</td><td>1296259200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B003VMCBEC</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've always used Photoshop for my raster images and Visio for my vector diagrams, so I'm used to the notion of different tools for different tasks and I'm aware that any tool will have its strengths & weaknesses. CorelDRAW X5 is a decent low-cost alternative for vector drawings, but definitely not a replacement for Photoshop.\n\nI'm happy with CorelDRAW, but a couple of things have made me say \"hmmm\".\n\nThe installation is HUGE.  The installer said that it was going to take a little more than 5GB, but I had just checked my drive space before the install and it seems like it took closer to 7GB.  It took a long time to install, so I don't want to uninstall/reinstall just to verify the numbers.\n\nFor some reason I've always been a little creeped out by Corel's EULAs (the legal gobbledygook you have to accept before installing). I don't typically read every word of of the EULA, but for some reason Corel's license agreements have always caught my attention. I'm not crazy about the notion that the application can check my system whenever it wants and report usage statistics at will and re-validate the license.\n\nThe packaging and the splash screen also make me uneasy in the way that they repeat over and over that this product is for home use only.  Even the application's title bar nags you:  \"CorelDRAW X5 (Not for commercial use) - [Untitled-1]\".  Before I installed it on my laptop I was really tempted to load it on my PC at work just to see if the black helicopters would come get me.  My wife wanted me to make up a sign for a garage sale, but I told her that would technically be \"commercial\" and that I was afraid the app would somehow detect my deceit and chop off my mouse finger.\n\nAnyway, aside from some of these weird cosmetic issues, it's a good tool for drawing. If you're not familiar with the CorelDraw family, there are plenty of resources included with the installation DVD. The PDF \"Guidebook\" is very well written and nicely presented.  If you're going to print it and use it as a desktop reference, maybe buy a new ink cartridge first, because it's very richly formatted with lots of colors.  They really did a nice job with the documentation.\n\nThere is also a user community at their website, which is a great way to get some backup support.\n\nAll in all, the functionality is very decent for the price.  There are also additional utilities included on the disc, like Corel Photo-Paint (similar to PaintShop Pro).\n\nIf you're looking for a low-cost graphics solution (as opposed to the Adobe Creative Suite of apps), then Corel is worth considering. But if you already have a background with any of the Adobe suite, then maybe consider the comparably-priced Adobe \"Elements\" applications.</td><td>01 29, 2011</td><td>A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9</td><td>Dave Edmiston</td><td>List(null,  Software, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Good drawing app</td><td>1296259200</td><td>false</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>B005GI19HY</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Symantec's,  Norton Internet Security, aka NIS, has been around for a while. I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since it was invented, I think. It hasn't caught every virus, or every malware, or all the other junk that comes my way, but it gets better and better, and in my opinion, I believe it is better overall than any other single program out there.\n\nTo be fair, I do use the free programs, Ad-Aware and Spybot Search and Destroy, when I believe I have been to a suspicious site, or that I have been compromised, and NIS hasn't caught anything. I don't believe any one program can catch it all as NIS, Ad-Aware, and Spybot, can all catch something that each of the others don't.\n\nSymantec can be a pain for customer support sometimes, but I guess I've gotten so used to using their FAQ that I can solve most problems myself. The most common in the past several years, is the program not recognizing that you've just bought the latest edition of the software and it tells you your subscription (free upgrades during the year) is about to expire.  You have to go in and monkey around to get it to reset and each year I cannot remember how I did it the year before so I have to look it up again.</td><td>01 29, 2012</td><td>A17CXXQUDPQASN</td><td>Computerboy</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Download, null, null, null)</td><td>Been using Symantec products since old man Norton was on the cover!</td><td>1327795200</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B005CELL1G</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Having been a satisfied user of PaperPort 9 for many years, and after hearing continued horror stories about every subsequent release, it was with great trepidation that I finally decided to upgrade to a newer version.  The upgrade to PP Pro 14.0 went smoothly, and I have used the product daily since then, and despite some quirks and bugs, I am happy that I finally upgraded.\n\nI have used PaperPort 9 extensively since it came out years ago for scanning and organizing virtually all paperwork that comes through my home and office, and it has long been one of the \"must-have\" applications that I use every day.  When I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 Pro 64 bit, I was dismayed to discover that PP 9 would not run on Windows 7 (nor would my Canon scanner), so I installed VirtualBox and used it to host a virtual Windows XP machine in which I could continue running both PP 9 and my scanner, which actually has worked pretty well.  (I tried the \"XP mode\" in Win 7 but it did not have good USB support that I needed for the scanner.) But PP 9 and my old scanner were aging and becoming more difficult to use for reasons described below, so it was time for an upgrade.\n\nSo I finally decided to take a chance and modernize with PP 14 and a new scanner.  Mindful of all the problems some people have reported, before doing the upgrade I took precautions.  To make sure that I could roll everything back if PP 14 messed up my system, I forced an immediate full backup to my Windows Home Server (I HIGHLY recommend anyone who uses Windows to get one of these), and then also set a system restore point in Windows 7 (via Control Panel/System).  This turned out to be unnecessary insurance because the upgrade completed without any problems.\n\nThe biggest problem I have had with PP 14 has been just figuring out all of the changes since version 9, which are extensive (and most of which I don't need), and also figuring out how to mate it up with the software for the new Canon scanner that I got to work with it.  Both PP and the scanner have a lot of options - everything seems to get more complicated, not less - and it took me a while to discover the best set of options for each.\n\nGood things:\n- The user interface is much more modern looking, and is visually similar to the Microsoft Office 2007 ribbon bar - love it or hate it.\n- It is noticeably faster than PP 9, especially when it comes to displaying document thumbnails.  My collection of scanned items is very large, so PP 9 was taking a long time to display any new folder full of documents.  PP 14 is much faster, which alone almost makes the upgrade worthwhile for me.\n- It creates and views PDF version 1.7 (the latest version), while PP 9 would only create and view PDF 1.4 (the version used by Acrobat 5).  That limitation in PP 9 was also another major motivator for my upgrade.\n- It, together with my new scanner, produces better images, faster than before, and also automatically applies some fixes such as auto-straighten which works very well.\n- And it runs natively under Windows 7, allowing me to get rid of the need to start a virtual machine in which to run Windows XP - this was taking a lot of memory, as well as extra time.\n\nNot-so-good things:\n- The user interface and workflow are more complicated than PP 9.  I don't need a lot of that stuff, which adds clutter and complexity.\n- I have experienced several non-critical (but nevertheless annoying) program crashes.\n- It apparently just won't work with the TWAIN driver for my scanner - only the WIA driver.  Neither PP nor my scanner was able to shed any light on this - I just had to muddle through by experimentation.\n- After installing PP 14, which comes with a bunch of auxiliary applications such as \"PDF Viewer Plus\" (which is made by DocuCom), I was unable to display most PDF files from Google Chrome - downloading important things like financial statements would result in an error box titled \"PDF Viewer Plus 7.1 - A file error has occurred.\"  This was a serious problem for me, but I was finally able to solve it by a non-obvious Chrome fix:  Type \"chrome://plugins\" in the Chrome input line to bring up a list of plugins, find \"DocuCom PDF Plus\" and disable it.\n\nOverall, two weeks after upgrading from PP 9 to 14, I am satisfied with the product and my decision to upgrade.</td><td>01 29, 2012</td><td>A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V</td><td>J.

I'm still okay with the Win 8 desktop mode but I'm now officially in the hate camp on the metro, New Windows Interface, or whatever that rubbish is called.  Before anyone gives me grief, hear me out.  I've given metro more than enough chances to win me over.  I just can no longer take this Frankenstein version of Windows trying to be all things to all people, tablet and PC.  It's a gimmick and one with irritating repercussions.  Take a recent email for example.  I had to send an immediate response to someone with attachments.  I replied in Windows mail (since it was conveniently there), went to insert attachments and found there was no way to do so.  I did my usual edge of the screen mouse hovering and saw everything from charms, to running programs, to the metro option, but nothing for attachments.  I had to back out of mail and search the web for the answer.  I learned I have to right-click an empty area of the message to bring up a sub-menu on the bottom (not even the normal context menu) that has more options, including inserting attachments.  If I had a touchscreen, all I would have needed to do was swipe.  Therein lies the problem.  Microsoft spent so much time catering to the tablet and touch crowd, they ruined a lot of the traditional desktop functionality in this mode.  What was previously a fast paced mouse clicking, keyboard shortcut typing paradise has been turned into a mess.  I really wish they gave us the option to choose between whether or not we want all that touch garbage installed at all.  I definitely would keep it off my PC and save the space.  It's just not worth the aggravation.  Sure, it's cutesy and all, with it's colorful tiles and live content, but navigation, usability, and usefulness are minimal.  I live in the desktop environment and that's all I want.  So to that end, I'll be going back to Windows 7 for as long as Microsoft supports it.  Just in case this is the new permanent mindset of Microsoft, I invested in a backup.  After being primarily a Windows user for over twenty years, I bought my first MacBook this past fall.  I'd tinkered with OSX and Linux here and there and even own an older iMac, but after trying the release previews of Windows 8 extensively, I figured if I had to learn a radically different OS design, I may as well make the switch to the least radically changed OS. Looks like my gamble paid off.  I am neither an Apple lover (because believe me, they have their issues too), nor a Microsoft lover but I definitely have to agree with Tim Cook's quote, a spot-on assessment of Windows 8:  \"I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don't think it would do all of those things very well.\"  In trying to compete with both the iPad and iMac in one swoop, Windows gave up their biggest advantage.  This can only help Linux and OSX.\n\nThat sums up my feelings of Windows 8 exactly. It tries to be a tablet and traditional PC combined but the end result is not very good.  I also wanted to point out, in my initial review I spoke of boot times and claims of incredibly fast boot times from people.  Well, I've recently started experiencing these short boot times myself and discovered it's because Microsoft has implemented a new shut-down scheme.  It's not really a \"shutdown\" in the traditional sense but more like an advanced hibernation mode.  I didn't initially experience these superfast boots but have been noticing them more and more lately.  I'm assuming it's because I'm no longer installing programs and other tasks that extend my boots/reboots.  At first, I thought I was somehow accidentally selecting sleep instead of shutdown.  I checked my event viewer and saw that it never mentions shutdown anymore, only sleep regardless of whether I select \"power off\".  I knew something was up, so I did a little digging and found info about the new boot mode.  There are parameters you can use to perform a true shutdown but once again, MS is forcing a PC to behave like a tablet.  I already have a tablet, so Windows 8 is not really necessary.  My advice, if you have a traditional PC and you're happy with Windows 7, stick with it.  If you primarily use your PC for web browsing, playing games and social activity, then Windows 8 isn't a bad choice, but if you're a power user and use your PC in a more traditional manner, you're likely not going to like it.  By the way, I'm STILL missing a couple drivers.  Last time that happened was Windows Vista.  That brought an interesting thought to mind; see if you recognize the pattern:  Windows 95/98, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.  Notice a trend?  Long time Windows users will notice immediately.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm, in the camp with those who neither love nor hate Windows 8.  I decided to upgrade after holding onto my copy of Windows 8 for over two months.  I bought it on Black Friday and just couldn't convince myself to install it, based on my last experience with the final preview version.  Well, I recently discovered that if you don't download and install the Media Center before January 31st, it would no longer be free and you would have to pony up an additional $20 for the ability to download it and have the capability to play DVDs and such.  So, I installed this past weekend and have been playing around with it since.  So far, my feelings about it are mixed.  I do feel that the uproar over metro (the purists will have to forgive me for calling it that, but it has no real distinguishing name, so it will be metro for this review) vs the desktop is much ado about nothing.  I spend 90% of my time in the desktop and have no problem getting there via the big \"desktop\" button on the metro screen or hitting the Start+B buttons.  The start menu is also overblown.  Yes, I was pretty upset at how Microsoft initially hid the programs and all the steps I had to take to get to them, however, once I figured out how to use charms, navigation became as quick and easy as it was with the Start menu.  Also, just to avoid any confusion, the taskbar is still there.  Yes, the date/time and little icons are all still on the right and your quick-launch shortcuts are still on the left.  Only the Start menu is missing.  Although I'm no fan of the metro interface, it does have its moments.  I like seeing mail, calendar, and other events in real-time live tiles.  Comparing the traditional desktop to metro is like the difference between iOS and Android.  Although metro is useful at times, I'd still prefer the choice to not use it so much.  Speaking of live tiles, that's another concern of mine, security.  From what I've read and heard, be very careful what content you put on the computer, especially photos.  I'm honestly leery about placing any photos or other super sensitive info on my PC now that Windows is so cloud-centric.  It's one thing to know that yes, there is a possibility your system could get compromised and your data illegally stolen; It's quite another when your computer is knowingly advertising your content.  My biggest likes of Windows 8 are increased functionality, better security, SOME features of IE 10, like spell-check (welcome to the 21st century, finally IE...), the mail and calendar integration (No Outlook necessary!) and the live tiles.  Another plus is that you don't \"need\" a touchscreen to navigate either interface.  I find navigating with the mouse to be relatively easy and think I'd prefer it even if I did have a touchscreen, other than the hot spots I'll address in the next paragraph.  So, that's pretty much it for now in the like column.\n\nOn the flip side, my list of dislikes is quite lengthy.  First, despite running the Windows Upgrade Advisor and being told many programs and drivers were compatible, many were not.  The funny thing is, Windows installed native drivers for devices it claimed needed updating and did not have native drivers for others it claimed were compatible.  After a lot of searching high and low, I found almost all of the drivers but I'm still missing one driver.  Several of my \"compatible\" programs either wouldn't run properly or wouldn't install at all, despite being listed as compatible in the WUA.  My second gripe is with the navigation.  Although you get accustomed to it, some long time Windows users will be pretty miffed at the changes because most are counterintuitive. Quirky requirements like hovering over random edges of the screen to bring up menus and the lack of traditional navigation options.  Also, some features that should be pretty straightforward take a little detective work to figure out, like how to add additional accounts after mail is set up or how to close metro apps like mail, calendar or even the metro version of IE, which is noticeably different from the desktop version.  They also took away some ease of use such as advance settings in networking.  They made it pretty much like a tablet to configure networking. Speaking of tablets, the merge of desktop and metro touch-oriented OS is a little convoluted.  For instance, there are apps that will only work in one or the other.  An example of this is an application I own that I've used in Windows for over a decade.  Well, they also now offer an app store version.  My desktop version only runs in the desktop mode (even if launched from the metro interface) and the app store version only runs in the metro interface, leading me to believe that the app store version (along with many other apps are really geared toward tablets).  If you thought distinguishing phone from tablet apps was hard in Android, wait until you have fun trying to figure out which apps are geared toward tablets versus PCs in the Windows App Store.  Although this is the last complaint I'll type, the list goes on.  My final complaint is the installation process.  Technically, for an upgrade, you must have a previous version of Windows already installed.  I installed on a clean wiped system (my preference always) and was unable to activate Windows after installation.  I called Microsoft and a nice gentleman assisted me with getting it activated via an alternative method.  I hope Microsoft intends to change this in the future because I do not wish to install a prior OS every time I need to rebuild, nor do I trust their \"erase everything and reinstall Windows\" option because if a nasty enough piece of malware hits you, I don't think any part of your disk is guaranteed safe, even hidden restore partitions.\n\nOverall, I don't regret the upgrade but had I not been pressed into upgrading now or losing the free media center, I likely would have stuck with Windows 7 for the foreseeable future.  I haven't personally observed any of the claimed performance gains nor any of the alleged sub-ten-second boot times, although I think the fast booters were booting from sleep mode and not a full power down.  Despite the aforementioned software and driver issues, I have not yet experienced any stability issues but I also haven't really stressed the system yet with some hardcore encoding or gaming.  Once I've had a chance to work out the kinks and truly test the OS, I'll be certain to report any and all issues encountered.</td><td>01 29, 2013</td><td>A2WB7LZ595CR50</td><td>J</td><td>List(null,  Software, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Headaches with few benefits</td><td>1359417600</td><td>false</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>B009HBCH6S</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>i have used TaxAct in direct comparison and it would have lost me 900.00.

I cannot understand how Intuit can mess up so consistently. Since the 2004 release, every update gets worse. This is up there with the worst of the worst. Good features that worked no longer work, little frustrating things never get fixed -- EVER! This goes on and on for years, and then more little frustrating problems get added. Over the years, I have sent Intuit a long list of items to fix. Never once have I received so much as one acknowledgement nor, to my knowledge, has one single item I have mentioned been fixed. I have not been asking for major feature additions or even enhancements. I have been asking for little things that any user would find beneficial. The irony is that I am a Software Design Engineer -- for about 30 years. So I don't send frivolous ideas.\n\nHere are some annoying examples of the functionality that is now no longer working in 2013: Whatever category you had for your downloaded items before the 2013 version is no longer used. Quicken just seems to pick whatever it wants. In my case, everything is categorized as \"Income.\" Also, if you enter in the category and memorize it, it still will not be recognized in the next download. If you rename payees, the renaming will not be seen by Quicken the next time that same payee is downloaded. If you click on a downloaded item in the bottom window that has already been Accepted, that item is no longer highlighted in the register. So getting back to it is time consuming and requires hunt and seek or search.\n\nI wanted to have a separate paragraph for this one: speed. Or, rather, the complete lack of it. It is even slower than the 2010 edition - which was a dog. I have a 4.4Ghz hexcore Intel machine with the fastest solid state drive money can buy. I have 64Gb of very high speed DDR. Quicken is now slower than ever. I don't know what others are experiencing on older machines with slow, spinning mechanical hard drives and 1.5Ghz dual core CPUs, but it must be a special form of torture.\n\nNow we are forced into an upgrade to keep our bank downloads. I call this extortion. The only way Intuit can get us to upgrade is to threaten to curtail downloading from our banks if we do not upgrade. Making a better user experience seems to never enter into their plans. Reporting to Intuit the problems and bugs is now so obfuscated that I do not even know how to do it. I have posted several messages to them, I thought, but they end up in some blog that generates user response. What can users do about bugs? Just ludicrous.\n\nIf you do not have to upgrade, then DO NOT. You have been warned.\n\n(See my other reviews to know that I review a lot and have no particular bias to grind.

One can hope.)</td><td>01 29, 2013</td><td>A238ZWM4J4WOD4</td><td>JohnSays</td><td>List(null,  Software Download, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Junk. Just unbelievable junk software.

It's not because you are really in Windows 7, because there is no real or easy control over what is there. And you are no longer on the Windows 8 screen. It needs to be one or the other.\n\nFinding out how to do stuff is a pain, because it seems very disorganized--things are not located where I expect them. Part of this is the Mac-emulation of \"Here, let me do it for you,\" which also means, \"Do it my way.\"  There are a number of reasons I don't buy Apple, and this is one of them, so I don't need their nonsense on my Windows machines.\n\nAlso bad: It is always on the Internet. It has cute pictures that run continuously, weather, etc., and you have to go to the trouble of turning it off. I spend a lot of time on the Internet. However, when I am working on something else, I don't need my machine spending time with open connections to the Internet. It is hazardous enough when I am actively online. Also, there are times I need the computing power of my machine and I don't want to share it.\n\nMy conclusion: I assume Windows 9 will have the Windows 8 interface all the time with no nonsense about switching back and forth between 8 & not-7. I have one computer switched to Win8, but I am going to wait until Win9 comes out to switch the others.</td><td>01 29, 2013</td><td>A1W78VPTNJJOF0</td><td>L.

The support from Kaspersky is subcontracted to Digital River and their Manila call center.  If you buy from Amazon, they will ask for your Kaspersky order number.  No Kaspersky order number, no assistance.  Period.  So, you are getting \"Support-less\" software when you buy it here.  I found this shocking.  My only question was where I had used 2 of the 3 seats or all 3 seats, since I had recently bought a new desktop, installed the software, but returned it due to a defect in the PC.  NO ONE AT DIGITAL RIVER COULD ANSWER MY SIMPLE QUESTION.  NOR DID THEY SEEM WILLING TO HELP.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that Amazon needs to look into this situation, because Kaspersky has instructed their call center not to assist customers who buy KIS software on Amazon.  It's as if it were counterfeit software.  So, IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT EVER NEED SUPPORT, AT ANY TIME, then pay a few $$ more and buy this on the Kaspersky website, or get Norton Internet Security instead.\n\nMeanwhile, I hope that Amazon Customer Service will look into this issue.

I am a retired attorney, and I have Office 2010 (Home and Student) installed for the rare occasion when I need to exchange heavily formatted docs with others. WordPerfect is so much more powerful and intuitive than Word -- and the \"Reveal Codes\" feature makes editing and revising documents infinitely easier. Oh, and yes, it reads and write most Word documents exceedingly well. Needless to say, my recent experiences with  Microsoft (like those of so many other whose reviews are published here) have been less than satisfying. P.S. I did not purchase Office 2016, and my rating was a neutral 3 to void misleading anyone.</td><td>01 29, 2017</td><td>A1GNYKVAT4ZHT1</td><td>Buzz Stephens</td><td>List(null,  Software Download, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Unintuitive, Crippled, and Less Perfect than WordPerfect</td><td>1485648000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0002D12D4</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>The reviews for Money 2005 are very good -- I suggest reading them all to see what you're in for.\n\nThe big problems for me were:\n\n1) The ability to have separate category and subcategory lists was removed from the transaction form\n\n2) I couldn't easily use the 'Transfer' category, especially in a split category\n\n3) Annoying duplicate account creation\n\nOn the first problem, Money 2005 uses just one combined category-subcategory list, so when you enter a transaction, you must choose a category-subcategory from one big list.  I prefer two distinct selections because it's quicker to enter and easier to find my subcategories.  Microsoft provides a Registery edit in the following Knowledgebase article:\n\n[...]\n\nI used the edit, and my separate lists are restored.  Great, but I am irritated that Money 2005 removed this option and provided no way for a user to change this behavior short of a Registery hack.\n\nOn the 2nd problem, my ability to 'Transfer' amounts to different account was resolved once I split my subcategory lists from my category lists using the above Registery hack.  Now, transfers operate as they did in Money 2003, which is the last version I was using.\n\nOn the 3rd problem, one financial institution has, for the 2nd time, downloaded duplicate accounts.  I hope it's an anomoly, but we'll see.  Other accounts operate fine.\n\nI haven't explored the strengths of 2005 yet -- this was just post-upgrade issues I've wrestled with over the New Year's weekend.  On the surface, doesn't look like much new is useful to me.\n\nOn the matter of online bill payment, I already had that through Wachovia bank (formerly First Union).  I guess what's new is that Microsoft now makes bill payment through Money work with many institutions.  Since Wachovia already provided this function, I don't think I'm adversely affected...or benefitted (though Wachovia dropped the $6 monthly fee for using Money's bill payment function).\n\nOne final piece of advice:  after you install, don't open your Money data file unless/until you have had Money perform all its software updates.  For me, I opened my Money 2003 file, was prompted to convert to Money 2005 file format, and then Money 2005 automatically downloaded software patches afterwards.  Wondering whether my conversion worked right nor not, I chose to open a backup of my Money 2003 data file using the patched copy of Money 2005, so any software bug fixes related to data conversion were already installed in Money 2005.\n\nI gave it a 2-star rating based solely on the upgrade process.

It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.

For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.\n\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.\n\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\n\nUI - at the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.</td><td>A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</td><td>Grimmy</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.

This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\n\n  What this is\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\n  - A great overview of using DW\n\nWhat it isn't\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.</td><td>AYUF7YETYOLNX</td><td>Bryan Newman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I decided (after trying a number of other products) to switch to the gold standard of web site management, Dreamweaver.

If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.\nAt some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version.

Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.\n\nThe opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it.

I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.\n* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\n* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\n\nOn the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\n\nVideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.</td><td>A2VWE5SGNDS8HW</td><td>tachi1</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.\n\nI should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\n*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\n* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\n* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\n* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\n* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\n* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.\n* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\n* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\n\nNOT SO POSITIVE:\n* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked.

You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.

You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.

Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the \"Classroom in a Book\" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.\n\nOne thing I got here more clearly than in the \"Classroom in a Book\" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.

I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.

I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.</td><td>A1MRPX3RM48T2I</td><td>Trenton Bennett</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options.\n\nThe full review:\nMore to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.

This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.

I was hesitant to embrace the subscription model especially when Google gives it away for free, but now I am a full believer thinking it is well worth it to keep my software up-to-date and running well across all computers without having to worry about upgrading every few years...or locking myself into Microsoft long-term if somebody else comes up with something better. The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels.  And the quality of the software and syncing interface makes me willing to pay for this.\n\nFinally, at this time through the Bing search engine you are able to get 100 GB of free One Drive space which has made it so I can keep all of my documents in the cloud, accessible and synced across all devices.

There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.\n\nInstallation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.\n\nIn use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).</td><td>AHNHLGKIZ2N3B</td><td>D.

There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.

You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.\n\nIn use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).</td><td>AHNHLGKIZ2N3B</td><td>D.

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.\n\nAn added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.\n\nInstallation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.\n\nIt did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually.

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.)

It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.\n\nThere are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.\n\nPlease note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.\n\nHere are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n\n Likes:\n\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\n\n Rants & Irritants:\n\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n\n Installation:\n\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n\n SkyDrive:\n\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n\n Summary:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review.

Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n\n Summary:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review.

The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.\n\nHere are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n\n Likes:\n\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\n\n Rants & Irritants:\n\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n\n Installation:\n\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite.

When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n\n SkyDrive:\n\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n\n Summary:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review.

This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email.  This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription.  I'm not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  It's just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there. (like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling.  If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.  There are many tutorials on the MS website to help you along.  I've used this software for years, and recommend it highly.

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).\n\nThe new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\n\nAs far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\n\nOffice 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\n\nMicrosoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating.

At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen.

It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge.

Using the \"Web\" version to do so is very similar to Google Docs - only with more features/functionality.\n\nUnlike other cloud-based sharing sites, saving to your SkyDrive is as simple as saving the document. For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive. From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).\n\nThe public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close. Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo. I would like to see one more choice: \"Direct Link,\" which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything.\n\nI've also installed Office 365 onto my wife's MacBook and her iPhone. It's good to know we have \"room to grow\" should we get another computer or smartphone. Up to 5 computers are supported, and also 5 smartphones.\n\nInstallation. All you need is that Product Key despite the boxy packaging (a vestige from another era).\n\nInstallation is easy: Enter your product key at [...] You can then install Office onto your Mac (or PC). There is a drop-down menu with a choice between a Mac or a PC. Up to 5 machines\n\nSame page for smartphones The drop-down menu lets you choose either Windows Phone, iPhone or Android phone. You can use Office apps on up to 5 devices. For my iPhone, I was instructed to enter my mobile phone number and it then sent an SMS with a url. I clicked that and a webpage opened then opened the AppStore to download the Office 365 app.\n\nFinal note: I advise all Office 365 users to make a copy (or two) of their product key (which comes on a business card-sized card) and store it in a safe place - better safe than sorry.</td><td>A379DLIAF0MFM5</td><td>Mr. Deeds</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>The software rental business is growing but at least Microsoft still has standalone version unlike Adobe and their CC product.

After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.\n\nThings glo has improved upon:\n\n++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are \"lenses\" that \"distribute content over a zoomable interface,\" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.\n\n++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.\n\n++  The user can check out the \"contributors and sources\" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.\n\n++  There is a \"Quick Install\" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.\n\n++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.\n\n++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.

As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.\n\nMany have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.\n\nThe initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.\n\nThis product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.\n\nThe best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a very good program.  Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think it's worth the effort.

GLO, however, is the best collection of information not only pertaining directly to the written words contained in the King James Version and for many others.
