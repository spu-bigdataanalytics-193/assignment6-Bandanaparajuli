For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn\\&#39;t go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don\\&#39;t expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\&#39;s important to note that there\\&#39;s a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn\\&#39;t covered here...it\\&#39;s possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)\\\\n\\\\nAs I said above, if you\\&#39;re a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.&#34;, &#34;summary&#34;: &#34;A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5&#34;, &#34;unixReviewTime&#34;: 1287532800}&#39;,\n",

The video is closed-captioned. You can set bookmarks. There are self-tests for each chapter as well.\\\\n\\\\nStarts off with \\\\&#34;what is HTML\\\\&#34; and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on \\\\&#34;the best way to lay out a site using CSS\\\\&#34; or anything like that. For that, you\\&#39;ll need a book or two on that subject.\\\\n\\\\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it\\&#39;s a decent introduction to creating web sites.\\\\n\\\\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking\\&#39;s voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it\\&#39;s not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\\\\n\\\\nUI - at the top of the interface, there\\&#39;s a \\\\&#34;Previous Video\\\\&#34; button and \\\\&#34;Next Video\\\\&#34; button. The \\\\&#34;Next Video\\\\&#34; button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you\\&#39;ll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \\\\&#34;Take Test\\\\&#34; instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\&#39;s a \\\\&#34;Watch and Work\\\\&#34; mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you\\&#39;ll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.&#34;, &#34;summary&#34;: &#34;A good value&#34;, &#34;unixReviewTime&#34;: 1287360000}&#39;,\n",

Fowler&#34;, &#34;reviewText&#34;: &#34;If you\\&#39;ve been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is \\\\&#34;Certified Associate,\\\\&#34; approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\\\\n\\\\nWith this software you\\&#39;ll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You\\&#39;ll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from \\\\&#34;Adobe Certified Instructors\\\\&#34;, a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.\\\\n\\\\nFor the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a \\\\&#34;test\\\\&#34; to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I\\&#39;ll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I\\&#39;ve simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you\\&#39;ll be learning on the videos.\\\\n\\\\nCONTENTS:\\\\n\\\\n1) HTML Refresher - This is an excellent section for someone who already knows HTML, but could use a refresher in the form of a \\\\&#34;crash course.\\\\&#34;  You\\&#39;ll find a URL overview, an HTML intro (tags, how some browsers read tags differently, and what Dreamweaver \\\\&#34;does behind the scenes).\\\\n\\\\n2) Dreamweaver Introduction - You\\&#39;ll finally be able to learn what WYSIWYG is, you\\&#39;ll be introduced to Dreamweaver Design, Code, and split screens, and the welcome screen.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I\\&#39;m embarrassed to say what version I am using.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW\\&#39;s capabilities.  It\\&#39;s now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn\\&#39;t be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.

If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A14638TGYH7GD9</td><td>Rebecca Haden</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Buy this with your copy of Dreamweaver</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.\n",

I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.\n",
       "\n",
       "POSITIVE:\n",
       "* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\n",
       "*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\n",
       "* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\n",
       "* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\n",
       "* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\n",
       "* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\n",
       "* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.\n",
       "* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\n",
       "* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\n",
       "\n",
       "NOT SO POSITIVE:\n",
       "* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.\n",
       "* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.\n",
       "* There is no \"search\" function or \"index.\" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.\n",
       "* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\n",
       "* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\n",

However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\n",

That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.\n",
       "\n",
       "The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the \"Classroom in a Book\" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing I got here more clearly than in the \"Classroom in a Book\" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).\n",

I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the \"Next Video\" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the \"Next Video\" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. \"Hawaiin\" instead of \"Hawaiian\"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the \"inverseKinematics_start.fla\" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.</td><td>11 27, 2010</td><td>AGVWTYW0ULXHT</td><td>Nate</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on \"best practices\"</td><td>1290816000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.\n",

The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video.

Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter.

This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n",

In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n",

The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n",

You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.

There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.

Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).</td><td>10 17, 2013</td><td>AHNHLGKIZ2N3B</td><td>D.

But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable.

You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.)

If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected.

       "Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n",

       " Likes:\n",
       "\n",
       "+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n",
       "+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n",

       " Rants & Irritants:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n",
       "\n",
       " Installation:\n",
       "\n",
       "The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n",
       "\n",
       "What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n",
       "\n",
       " SkyDrive:\n",
       "\n",
       "I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n",
       "\n",
       " Word:\n",
       "\n",
       "The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n",
       "\n",
       "Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n",
       "\n",
       " Excel:\n",
       "\n",
       "On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n",
       "\n",
       "But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n",
       "\n",
       " OneNote:\n",
       "\n",
       "This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n",
       "\n",
       " PowerPoint:\n",
       "\n",
       "There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n",
       "\n",
       " Outlook:\n",
       "\n",
       "There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n",
       "\n",
       " Publisher:\n",
       "\n",
       "I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n",
       "\n",
       " Access:\n",
       "\n",
       "The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n",
       "\n",
       " Annoyances & Irritants:\n",
       "\n",
       "My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n",
       "\n",
       " Suggestions:\n",
       "\n",
       "Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n",

I'm not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  It's just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there. (like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling.  If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.  There are many tutorials on the MS website to help you along.  I've used this software for years, and recommend it highly. I'm particularly fond of the Outlook mail program, and wouldn't get a version that doesn't include it.</td><td>09 29, 2013</td><td>AZZ5ASC403N74</td><td>Rose Blue</td><td>null</td><td>This is the premier office software</td><td>1380412800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>I'm not sure why so many people are having problems downloading and installing Microsoft Office 365. As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).\n",
       "\n",
       "The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\n",
       "\n",
       "As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\n",
       "\n",
       "Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating.

As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.\n",

       "Many have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.

You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.

I enjoy reading the Bible for its historical information and have found over the years many different iterations of the Bible.  GLO, however, is the best collection of information not only pertaining directly to the written words contained in the King James Version and for many others.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background.  For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used.  The words, however, come through and are the same.  The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO's annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  That's a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.  There are hundreds of meaningful pictures coupled with historical facts and comparisons.  I have found that reading the Bible is significantly rewarding and far better than listening to it on a recording.

You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading.

Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.\n",

       "Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.\n",

I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it.

It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration.

We will probably purchase this software again around 2015 to update again, unless circumstances seem to indicate that we need to update sooner.</td><td>11 18, 2012</td><td>A2AMTEB5UZEOXE</td><td>Kelly</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Straightforward, easy to use</td><td>1353196800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1413313701</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>For me, WillMaker served better as a guide than as a replacement for an attorney.

The templates aren't forgiving for creative wishes but the time spent practicing with WillMaker no doubt will reduce the time spent with an attorney. For that reason alone, I recommend the software. Whether you use WillMaker alone or use it as a springboard to develop your will with an attorney, the software will educate you and save you money.\n",

       "WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.\n",

       "I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my \"final intentions\" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say \"give it all to so-and-so\".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.\n",

I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)\n",
       "\n",
       "This 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Other than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.\n",

       "For most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.\n",

If, however, you don't want to hire a lawyer and you don't know how to pull together every form you might need for end of life legal dispositions (will, health care directive, etc.) and you don't have a big or complicated life, this will do the trick nicely and save you a lot of money.

The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day.

I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.\n",

       "When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's \"search\" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge.

       "Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website.

Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.\n",

       "Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.\n",

The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.\n",

       "The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards.

       "Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks.

This also may explain why the game is shorter; I'm guessing they realized that the game would be better if it took longer, so the other two games (\"Stay Tuned For Danger\" and \"Message In a Haunted Mansion\") have more playing time.  On the other hand, because it is shorter, it's also easier, so this might be better for slightly younger girls than the other two.  Also, this game requires 2 CDs--you have to switch back and forth.  This was annoying at first, but soon became bearable.  But really, this game was a lot of fun.

       "This game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of \"Light of Our Love\" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...\n",

       "The plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "The quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "The graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).\n",
       "\n",
       "The characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where \"Light of Our Love\" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of \"Light of Our Love\". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive \"suspects\". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "The music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect \"New York City\" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.\n",

I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP.

In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them.

I want an OS with a GUI that \"just works\" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows.

       "What I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesn't hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.\n",

The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility.\n",

So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time.

In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.  Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!)  This game will take you many hours to complete.  For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from \"The Secret of the Old Clock\", with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.  Also, if after you've installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL.  If you're using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on \"Display\", then clicking on the \"Settings\" tab, then clicking the \"Advanced...\" button, then clicking the \"Performance\" tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to \"Full.\"  Then you'll need to restart you computer.  This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!

I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait?

A really fun, exciting, game for girls -- that DOESN'T come in a pink box, for heaven's sake.

There were plenty for boys; and a few for both sexes, like \"Tetris\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\", and, of course, the ever-popular \"Mario Bros.\" series.  But even the Mario games favored boys.  There were always more male characters to choose from than females (there'd be, maybe one girl, the Princess, who sported a pink dress.) And the games JUST for girls would be, like, Atari's \"Strawberry Shortcake\" game, where you'd get to switch around everybody's outfits.  Now, in the year 2001, there's plenty of girl software out there, but I'm not interested in PC Diaries, where girls can record their innermost secrets and keep them locked up with a voice-activated password.  I've outgrown being interested in designing clothes for Barbie.  (They need a game where you can design a Barbie house!  Now that would be cool.)  Not that there's anything wrong with those games; it's just that they're very tame, and some girls, like myself, want adventure.  Believe it or not, the box for this Nancy Drew game sports the phrase \"For adventurous girls, ages 10 and up.\"  That's me! (A bit over 10, but who's counting?)  But enough with the introductions -- let me describe the game.  It's an adventure game; \"Choose Your Own Adventure\"-esque.  Nancy is staying in a mansion that's someday going to be a Bed & Breakfast.  There's a problem though -- a bunch of accidents have been happening.  Your job, as Nancy, is to find clues, solve puzzles, talk to people, and solve the mystery of who's responsible for the accidents.  But you soon discover that you have a SECOND mystery to deal with.  This game requires logic, patience, and a curious mind.  What amazed me was how long the game took to complete; there's really a lot to do.  But after about 14-16 hours of game play, I have finished the game, and I'm sad.  So -- I think I'll order the other two Nancy Drew games that are on amazon! ;)  Please, DreamCatcher games and Her Interactive -- keep these coming!  I want more Nancy Drew games.

       "PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.\n",
       "\n",
       "I thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said \"20+ hours of gameplay\", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered \"educational\". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like \"Oh great, here comes another history lesson.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.\n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.\n",
       "\n",
       "PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle \"in the corner\". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.\n",
       "\n",
       "IS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like \"Maybe you should take a look at the library again!\" it was more \"Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf.\" Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.\n",
       "\n",
       "ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.\n",

       "Rose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?\n",
       "\n",
       "The plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first \"haunted house\" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.\n",
       "\n",
       "I will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.\n",
       "\n",
       "The graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.\n",
       "\n",
       "The characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.\n",
       "\n",
       "One wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.\n",
       "\n",
       "The music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.\n",
       "\n",
       "Message in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.</td><td>05 26, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>The Message: This Game Rocks!</td><td>1306368000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>After success with the first two games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, the creators tried to step up the suspense with a scarier mystery.  In \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.\n",
       "\n",
       "Story-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.\n",
       "\n",
       "Graphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.\n",
       "\n",
       "Length-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.\n",

       "The only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with \"Treasure in the Royal Tower.\" But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the sance, and the many puzzles.

Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.\n",

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This \"smart-switch\" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.\n",
       "\n",
       "Design:\n",
       "One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.\n",

       "\n",
       "The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.\n",
       "\n",
       "The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no \"power brick\" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.\n",
       "\n",
       "The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Configuration:\n",
       "I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.\n",
       "\n",
       "' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.\n",

       "\n",
       "The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.\n",
       "\n",
       "The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:\n",
       "' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)\n",
       "' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)\n",
       "' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).\n",

       "' Multicast control via IGMP snooping\n",

       "\n",
       "Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n",
       "\n",
       "Green Power Use:\n",
       "The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n",
       "\n",
       "Support:\n",
       "I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Conclusions:\n",
       "The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n",
       "\n",
       "The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n",
       "\n",
       "I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.\n",
       "\n",
       "I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.\n",

       "This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unpacking\n",
       "\n",
       "The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n",
       "\n",
       "Installation\n",
       "\n",
       "You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hardware\n",
       "\n",
       "All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n",
       "\n",
       "One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n",
       "\n",
       "Software\n",
       "\n",
       "The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n",
       "\n",
       "I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n",
       "\n",
       "A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n",
       "\n",
       "Features\n",
       "\n",
       "The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n",
       "\n",
       "During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Bad\n",
       "\n",
       "The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n",
       "\n",
       "Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00.

After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.

I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.</td><td>01 21, 2010</td><td>AR4NKM7NXG92G</td><td>A. B.

This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says \"T7Hub\" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for \"permanent\" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.

I had some very weird things happen with 2000 such as its not publishing to the web on the index page unless I also saved it in Notepad.  All the bugs are gone in 2002 plus it is much easier to use.  I use it for everything, rarely using Word, Office and so forth.  My two major tools for editing and writing are Front Page and super Notepad instead.  I am going to learn Dreamweaver next term at the college where I teach because I am finally ready to move on and learn more about professional  web design.  Besides, I can now read and write html so I am not as utterly dependent on Front Page as I once was.  If you don't know any html coding, the basis of all web pages, Front Page is the program for you.  I also do all my image editing in Photoshop so don't even need that function in Front Page.  Dreamweaver is the industry standard instead of Front Page yet Front Page is the ordinary user's program of choice.  The reason for this is that you can know very little about computers and still make a website with Front Page.  It even made publishing websites idiot proof by using Front Page Server extensions with many web host providers.  Thus, one can totally skip learning ftp protocol by using Front Page server extensions instead.  If someone wants to go professionally into web page design, this is not the product, Dreamweaver is.  People who already are professionals in the computer industry or in web design tell me they don't like Front Page.  I think the reason is that since they don't need (or want) Front Page to do their work for them, they desire a program which gives them a much freer hand.  For the average computer user though, that is all pie in the sky, beyond their reach, and Front Page 2002 will more than do the job for them.</td><td>11 28, 2002</td><td>AW3VZ5O895LRK</td><td>carol irvin</td><td>null</td><td>Huge Improvement Over 2000</td><td>1038441600</td><td>false</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>B00005AFI2</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft.

If all you'll be doing is adding content to a page, you should have no problems using FrontPage on any servers. FrontPage is an extremely powerful software package that costs a lot less than most other equivalent products. As a piece of the Office XP product line, FrontPage 2002 will be as easy and as powerful as other products you are using, and will integrate itself with those other products. If you need to put part, or even a whole, word document on a page FrontPage will do that with ease. You can also include Excel data, and other types of office documents. If you have not yet purchased an HTML editor, get FrontPage and save yourself a lot of hassle and money with other brands. If you have already begun that hassle, end it now with FrontPage 2002.\n",

It behaved as if I had never unloaded it the first time.  My alloted number of uses (before activation) decreased so something is still in there saying it was on there before (yes, yes, yes...in the registry).  Ok, Bill wants a new mansion so he is trying to prevent piracy.  I can understand that.  HOWEVER, my next concern is realllllyyy big.  In ME, you can set a restore point.  This restore point allows you to reconfigure your PC to a point from the past.  This is present just in case a new program you load has some problems, etc....  Now remember, ME is Mr. Gate's program just like Publisher.  I had to reformat my hard drive (thanks to Microsoft's Encarta Reference Library).  My system was fresh as a daisy.  I re-loaded Publisher out of curiosity to see what would happen.  I created a restore point PRIOR to loading it.  I didn't activate it because I didn't want it.  I unloaded it.  Just to test the system, I used my restore function.  If you are following me carefully, you can tell I have already made two changes since creating the restore point:  loading and unloading Publisher.  Guess What!?!  ME wouldn't allow the restoration because NOTHING HAD CHANGED ON MY PC!  HELLO???  I loaded and unloaded a program; I consider that a change.  Let's say Publisher had a problem and didn't work.  In order to get it off my PC, I would have to do ANOTHER format for my hard drive.  That, my friends, is scary.  And to add on to another person's review.  That person was incorrect when he/she said you could only have it on two PC's and would be out of luck if one crashed.  You can get it activated again and give some excuse as to why it needs to be reactivated (at least, that's what the support person told me).

I love history, and this game is full of that. But the best part about it? The exploring. I will admit that the movements are a little bit limited, but this is only the fourth game.

       "Nancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...\n",
       "\n",
       "This is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (\"fictional\" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little \"toned down\" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).\n",
       "\n",
       "Like the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing.

       "\n",
       "While the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her \"theory\" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).\n",
       "\n",
       "Like the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.\n",
       "\n",
       "The game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall \"castle\" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically \"royal\", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.\n",

       "PLOT - 4.5/5: Nancy's ski vacation is cut short when a blizzard keeps her stuck in the Wisconsin castle she's staying at. Apparently in the 1920's, some guy who really loved French castles decided to build one in Wisconsin, and even imported a tower from Marie Antoinette's castle to be added on to his. Nancy learns that Marie Antoinette was rumored to have left a treasure somewhere in the castle, so it's up to her to find the treasure before someone else tears the castle apart trying to find it. I thought this was a really good plot, and everything else into the story tied into it nicely. I only wish it had been longer, it was a little shorter than I had hoped.

The hotel's guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so I'm going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.\n",

The puzzles range from easy to hard, but they are all solvable without any need of a walkthrough.

When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar.

Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL.

For those of us that are familiar with Win 2K you will find that many things are not in places where we are used to them being.  This is a small problem and im sure that I will become comfortable with it.  My main gripe is the constant application lock ups in this OS for no apparant reason.  For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer, then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again.  Same goes true for Outlook.  Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out, or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows.  Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday.  Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason.  To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating \"sorry for the inconvience\" and an option to send the error report to microsoft. HA!  It looks like Microsoft expected this OS to have a lot of problems (and that it does) and are using the customers to find all their bugs for them.

       "In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.

Example of this would be remote desktop, an amazing feature that allows you to actually control your computer from another computer running Windows XP Pro. Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is \"awesome\", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The \"start menu\", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the \"start menu\" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, \"ME\" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. \"KODAK\". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro.

The advantage of the Professional version lies in laptops, businesses, and anyone who considers themself a \"power user\". In the professional version we have enhanced tools for system administrator and advanced networking tools. The only drawback is that some of your DOS based programs and drivers may not work under XP due to its true 32-bit coding.

You also have an option of a \"classic\" Windows 9x view.\n",

It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party \"usage tracking\" cookies that are placed on your PC.\n",
       "Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that \"DOS EMULATORS\" will be available for purchase in the near future.\n",
       "Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.\n",
       "For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.\n",

So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly won't work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP.

Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is \"awesome\", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The \"start menu\", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the \"start menu\" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, \"ME\" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. \"KODAK\". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home. It all depends on the user and the environment, as simple as that.</td><td>01 19, 2002</td><td>A15S4XW3CRISZ5</td><td>Andre Da Costa</td><td>null</td><td>Windows XP Professional (Depends)</td><td>1011398400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005MOTG</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Perhaps I've become so jaded that all Windows systems now look the same.\n",

       "The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the \"old computer,\" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).\n",

       "Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.\n",

You also have an option of a \"classic\" Windows 9x view.\n",
       "Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party \"usage tracking\" cookies that are placed on your PC.\n",
       "Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didn't work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that \"DOS EMULATORS\" will be available for purchase in the near future.\n",
       "Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.\n",
       "For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.\n",
       "For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.\n",

That shows you how wonderful this operating system is.  XP is not perfect; but it works well enough to keep the average computer user happy with the condition of their computer. It is virtually idiot proof and it is very difficult to 'mess it up'.  The system restore function is a big plus.  Also, Windows XP keeps your system files from being corrupted by viruses by not allowing unauthorized access to the files.  I'm not saying that it's virus-proof, but much more secure than previous Windows versions.

       "First and foremost, the \"Blue Screen of Death\" is gone!  I run XP on three computers in my home via a home network, and I have literally never seen the dreaded Blue Screen.  While both Windows 98 (which I thought was a pretty good OS) and Windows ME (horrible!!!) require frequent re-booting, XP does not.  You can go weeks, even months, without rebooting XP.  It is stable and reliable.\n",
       "Speaking of home networks, XP Home Edition does a very good job if you want to set up a peer-to-peer network in your home.  We run one notebook (via a wireless connection base station hub) and two desktops via XP, and you can literally set something like this up in less than an hour, counting hardware hookups.  The Networking Wizard actually works, and takes almost all of the pain out of setting up a network.  If you want a peer-to-peer home network, XP is for you.\n",
       "One warning--XP does not support a domain (server) network.  If you are interested in this sort of configuration you want Windows Professional Edition.  You cannot use XP for this.\n",
       "Windows XP is well-supported as regards various peripheral devices.  When I upgraded, I had no difficulty downloading the necessary drivers for my three printers, one scanner, and various other devices.  Most worked OK out of the box, but upgraded drivers are available from most vendors via the internet.\n",
       "Speaking of the Internet, XP is truly dependent upon the Internet, and I would imagine that a user without Internet access would find XP very difficult to use.  XP is among the new generation of software of which Internet access is an integral design assumption.  The OS uses the Internet to register itself, obtain updates, and obtain drivers.  This is reflective of a trend whereby in my opinion every computer installation will in a very real way have as its centerpiece the Internet connection of the user.  Dial-up's days are numbered too--XP files, like most files nowadays, are simply too large for a 56K dial-up modem.\n",

I even like it better for using Photoshop and Illustrator than a Mac and that statement is virtually heresy in the art world! First, it is not buggy and not crash prone.  It reliably works all of the time.  Windows 2000 was very good in that regard and XP is even better. 95 and 98 were terrible regarding crashes and reliability. I'm also using Windows Media Player 9 with it, which is a terrific player, and I'm even able to use all wma files (1/3 the size) rather than mp3 after using a converter. I stopped using Real Player after getting on this Player 9, which works the best with XP.  Second, if I need help on something on my computer, I can have my friend in a different city, also on XP, take over my controls using the Net Meeting feature.  He was able to reinstall a program for me that was giving me fits.  Third, there are loads of special programs that work especially in conjunction with XP that further enhance it, such as Firegraphic 5 where you can see all your images and view them in filmstrips, slide shows and big versions. And that's just one of many special programs that I've used on XP.  It is also a delight to go to any website and find that whatever you can download there is compatible with XP.  One thing that would really turn me off a Mac, by contrast, is the notice on many programs or features on the web that they haven't developed a version yet for a Mac.  I also like the way Windows Explorer works in XP and that it looks better than in any earlier version of Windows.  As my giant file cabinet, it is very easy for me to keep everything organized in WE and the thumbnails of my jpgs, tifs, ais, htms and so forth are terrific.  The task bar is much improved from 2000 and I found I could even get rid of my pop up remover program because XP makes it so easy to close multiple browser windows with one right click on the task bar on a grouped browser window button. I also get beautiful thumbnails now when I use right click.

Whatever the case, Nancy Drew has once again proved me wrong. My intuition on these games must be seriously off, because every game I'm sure I won't like ends up being one of my favorites. And this has indeed become one of my favorites of the early Nancy Drew titles. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n",

       "PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is hired as the Deputy Curator at a Washington, DC museum called Beech Hill. It is quite an exciting time for Beech Hill because they are preparing to open a new exhibit on the Maya, the highlight of which will be a very rare (and very expensive) artifact - a large elaborately carved stone called a monolith.\n",
       "\n",
       "But poor Nancy just has the worst luck when it comes to vacations and dream jobs. Before she knows it, Beech Hill is robbed of one of its most beloved artifacts; a rare and unusual jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal. It seems to be related to a string of art thefts happening across the country, since in all the incidents Mayan jade artifacts were the target and a threatening red handprint was left at the scene.\n",
       "\n",
       "I thought this plot was just wonderful. It was well thought out, thorough, and unique among other ND titles. The length was perfect; I finished it over the course of a few days. There were lots of little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. It was interesting and intriguing, and very educational. Let me repeat that; it was VERY educational. It is set in a museum, after all. There is tons of information to take in - some of which is vital to the mystery of some of which is not. I have always loved history and am especially interested in the Maya and Aztec so this game was just my cup of tea. But if you don't like history - or aren't a big fan of plenty of reading in a ND game - this game might not be for you.\n",
       "\n",
       "CHARACTERS - 4/5: Suspects in this game include Joanna Riggs, the curator of Beech Hill and therefore Nancy's boss, a fairly serious young woman with a history of being a bit too eager to acquire artifacts for the museum. Henrik van der Hune is the museum's resident expert in translating Mayan glyphs, so he is arguably the only person in the museum who can guess an artifact's true value. Then there is Taylor Sinclair, an art dealer located in DC, who often does business with Joanna and appears to be unusually concerned over the museum's safety. Finally, there is Alejandro del Rio, a Mexican ambassador who accuses Beech Hill and other museums like it of flat-out stealing artifacts that rightfully belong to Mexico.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phone friends include Bess and George, the Hardy Boys, and Franklin Rose, who is a member of the Beech Hill board of directors and friend of Nancy's father. There are quite a few one or two time phone friends related to the plot as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unfortunately, the four suspects weren't very memorable. Their personalities were not particularly well defined and there wasn't anything quirky or fun about them. Worst of all, none of them were very suspicious. Basically, no one from this cast of characters is going to be making my favorites list anytime soon. However, the previous deputy curator, Sonny Joon, seen only in notebooks he left behind at the museum, was absolutely hilarious and his notebooks were a delightful comic relief. I hear he shows up again in some of the newer titles so I'm really looking forward to that.\n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING - 5/5: The setting was excellent. Beech Hill was very interesting and there was tons to look at inside. If it were a real museum I would definitely visit. Other places to see include Nancy's hotel room, Taylor's office, Alejandro's office, as well as some other locations that are unlocked throughout the course of the game. One thing that really blew me away was how realistic it all was. There were little things - like how could you see the exterior of every building before you entered it - that made a huge difference. It was so easy to get into the mystery because it really felt like I was there.\n",
       "\n",
       "PUZZLES - 4.5/5: I liked the puzzles, though this game tended to repeat itself as far as puzzles go. In other words, you do the same thing a few times throughout the game. The puzzles in the museum were mostly information scavenger hunts, where Nancy would be posed with a quiz question and you would have to search the museum exhibits for the answer. That didn't bother me, but I could easily understand someone finding it tedious and too slow-paced. In hindsight this game wasn't as puzzle-heavy as some other ND titles, which worked for me as I'm not a huge puzzle fan. But the puzzles did work in seamlessly with the plot and I never felt like I was stuck doing something unnecessary just to make the game longer.\n",
       "\n",
       "IS IT CHALLENGING? Not really. Most - if not all - of the puzzles are explained by the game, and Nancy can call her friends for hints. I did go online for help once for a game of \"chance\" that I lost maybe 20 times in a row, thinking that there might be some strategy I was missing. But it seems that the mini-game couldn't be won until you reached a certain point in the plot, which frankly was pretty frustrating to learn I had wasted all that time. Anyways, I would give it a 3 for challenge.\n",
       "\n",
       "ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was probably the only part of this game that really didn't impress me. Although the ending was very intense, it was just sort of awkward and didn't make a whole lot of sense. The culprit wasn't too predictable and their motive made sense. Overall the ending was underwhelming. But be warned that the ending of this game is pretty creepy, and because of it I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for young children.\n",

       "The setting was great, and unlike any that's been seen in a Nancy Drew game before (or since). While there is more limited exploration, the areas that were able to be explored were nicely decorated and fully-interactive. I liked walking through the temple of Maya games and playing them all, as well as exploring other areas in Washington D.C. The abundant exploration that was in the previous three installments is definitely lacking here, though. There were several locations that didn't serve much of a purpose in the game (save to talk with a specific suspect) and the museum lacked any secret passageways. Regardless, the places that the suspects are conversed with are very nicely detailed and I rather enjoyed seeing different areas and buildings in Washington, D.C. while living vicariously through Nancy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some of the chores were rather tedious, such as matching up an exhibit with its correct recording. However, chores like these were the exception instead of the rule. Most of the games were rather entertaining, especially the maze and ancient Mayan games.\n",
       "\n",
       "The suspects are probably the most disappointing aspect in this game. They include the museum curator, Joanna Riggs, Henrik Van Der Hume, the artifact expert, Alejandro del Rio, the attach to the Mexican Consulate, and Taylor Sinclair, the art dealer who helped Joanna get her hands on several of the artifacts that will soon be put on display. As a whole, the suspects are rather flat and unable to be conversed with much. Joanna is especially guilty of this, as her character definitely borders on useless. Most questions Nancy asks her, she answers with something along the lines of \"Henrik can help you with that.\" Taylor and Alejandro are hardly much better when it comes to development, only serving to be conversed with once every so often and not providing much insight into the case. On the contrary, Henrik was awesome and nicely developed, and he winds up playing a very large role in the game itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "While three of the four suspects weren't very developed, they all did have some great motives to be the culprit in the end. Even though I didn't see this culprit coming when I first played the game, I see in hindsight that he/she is truly the most logical choice. This is definitely another game in which I cannot see anybody but the guilty party as the culprit in the end.\n",
       "\n",
       "As stated before, the suspects weren't very nicely integrated. The phone friends, on the other hand, were very well scripted and employed. I loved all of the conversations that Nancy has on the phone with people, as they were humorously and cleverly composed. Most importantly, several characters that play important roles in the Nancy Drew series as a whole make their first appearance in this game, including Frank and Joe Hardy (AKA The Hardy Boys), Poppy Dada, Prudence Rutherford, and Sonny Joon. This is also the first game to feature the name of the Krolmeister company, which will play a substantial role in the games to come.\n",
       "\n",
       "The music was definitely different when compared to other games, in that it has more of a \"historical\" and \"nature\" feel to it, while the soundtracks of other games were more \"mysterious\" and \"elegant\". This, however, is a bonus for this game. While previous games have focused on bandits, royalty, and magicians, this game focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization. The soundtrack was great for a museum filled with the histories of these ancient people, and all the tracks certainly felt in place.\n",

       "Is \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" my favorite Nancy Drew game of all time? No. Does it rank high on the list, though? Most definitely. While I did prefer the previous three games, this one certainly holds up to the high standards that the Nancy Drew series has set for itself. The plot is wonderful, and ultimately leads to an unforgettable and heart-pounding encounter that I never saw coming.

Other than that it's a great game, and I have the following comments on it:\n",
       "\n",
       "Story-You have a summer internship working at a Mayan museum in Washington D.C.  For those of you who don't know, the Mayan civilization was an Indian civilization that vanished without a trace.  Anyway, you are doing basic chores when a certain artifact is stolen, and a scarlet hand print is left at the scene of the crime.  Hence the title.  Eventually, you solve this mystery only to have another one thrown at you in the middle of the game, so you are actually getting 2 stories in 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "Graphics-These are pretty good graphics, with the backgrounds looking pretty real.  The characters still look definitely fake, but this has pretty good graphics still.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sound-The music is okay with kind of a Mayan twist on it, but the voice acting really isn't that great.  And the lips are REALLY off.  I ignore it, and it doesn't bother me, but others it might bother a little bit.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gameplay-The gameplay is exactly the same as the others in the series.  It is first person point-and-click.  You ride a metro system to get places, and the alarm clock is back, allowing you to go to sleep and wake up anytime you want.  The puzzles in this game are a little more difficult and numerous than in other games, and some of them are quite boring, but most are fun, and I can forgive the ones that aren't.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fun-This game is pretty fun, but unlike the other games where there is just a tad bit of learning mixed in among the mystery, in this game, prepare to learn a LOT about Mayan history.  I hated it, because I hate history, but my friend loved it because he likes history.  I think the producers were just trying to appeal to history lovers as well as mystery lovers in this game, and I understand that.  No bad enough to give 3 stars, but not good enough for 5.\n",
       "\n",
       "Length-Oh.  My.  Goodness.  This is a rather long game.  It took me several months to finish, and whenever I replay it (which is a lot) it will take me about 12-15 hours because I still have trouble with some of the puzzles!\n",
       "\n",
       "The puzzles are hard, but the answers are in the game, you just have to look for them.  The history is boring, but the story is great!  A great addition for history buffs, but if you don't like history, this game is still worth playing through at least once!</td><td>12 13, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>null</td><td>There is a large focus on Mayan history in this game</td><td>1260662400</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have played all the Nancy Drew titles from Her Interactive, and Secret of the Scarlet Hand (based on Nancy Drew book 125) is the best (and most impressive) of the lot. In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.\n",
       "First, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.\n",
       "\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.\n",
       "This is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. \"Scarlet Hand\" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and \"Scarlet Hand\" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.</td><td>07 10, 2003</td><td>A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</td><td>Bundt Lust</td><td>null</td><td>&iexcl;Bienvenido al mundo de los maya!</td><td>1057795200</td><td>false</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is the 6th in this series by HER Interactive. Each game is full of clues, puzzles, and exciting (and possibly dangerous) adventures. \"Scarlet Hand\" is no exception. In this game, you (as Nancy) take an internship at the Beech Hill Museum, and when a priceless artifact goes missing, it's up to you to find out what's going on. You'll explore the museum (which includes a pyramid with several levels, and an outside exhibit), and take the subway to visit several other key locations. You'll talk to various people, all the while knowing that one of them could be the thief. It's a really fun game; I've played all the others and this one took longer than the previous game (\"Final Scene\") for me. It took about 10 hours on the senior level, and I was playing it with a partner. There are a lot of facts to write down and recall, and the puzzles in this game are very original. I was very pleased with the number of puzzles; just the right amount. What I really liked about this game, in comparison to some of the other Nancy Drew games, was that you didn't have to maneuver your mouse so much to find things. In some of the other games, you can only see objects if you position your cursor at just the right angle turning just the right direction. In this game, everything was very out in the open and the game was easy to maneuver; surprisingly, however, that didn't make the game any less challenging than its predecessors. Just another great addition to the \"Nancy Drew\" games collection, \"Scarlet Hand\" is sure to please gamers and mystery-lovers alike.</td><td>09 15, 2002</td><td>A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2</td><td>Molly P.</td><td>null</td><td>Another great game!</td><td>1032048000</td><td>false</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>B000069IL2</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>That's right, the free bill pay offer via MSN is worth more than the price of the software alone.

Thirdly, you can batch epayments together and send them all at once (conversely, Money 2002 sent a payment by piecemeal, which was extremely slow and frustrating).  Fourthly, a good product has been tweaked to iron-out some of the frustrations of earlier versions.  In all -- it's a nice piece of software.\n",
       "What I don't like:  So far, I like everything I've seen.  If there is something you don't like about Money, in all likelihood, there is an Options setting that will correct the problem.  For example, to remove \"sponsor\" ads from within Money, find the option setting to stop displaying all sponsor's ads (by default, they'll show up).  Also, when upgrading from an earlier version of Money, the newly-installed Money 2003 installation isn't smart enough to know that you already have a Money file that you want to just pick-up and use.  You have to exit out of the set-up prompts, click File, Open and go from there.

Something frightening has been happening ever since she's moved into her new home in Moon Lake, Pennsylvania, and she's hoping that Nancy can find out what. Nancy naturally agrees to drive out, only to find out that Sally's been frightened away from her home. What exactly did this? The answer comes all too quickly when pack of four ghost hounds that attack the house while Nancy's inside. Legend has it that they once belonged to Mickey Malone, the gangster who originally lived in the house, until their beloved owner passed away. Upon his death, the dogs ran off into the neighboring woods, and could be heard howling in the distance until they all died. They now return every time somebody tries to live in the old Malone home.

The last suspect is Ranger Jeff Akers, the park ranger for Moon Lake who enjoys bossing people around.

At night, the music becomes slower and more eerie, and it was complimented by the sound of chirping crickets.

I thought this was a really good plot. Unlike in some other ND titles, I really wanted to solve the mystery and find out where these dogs were coming from.

This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the \"ghost dogs.\" Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house.\n",
       "Nancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or flesh-and-blood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Em's Emporium (Moon Lake's general store), Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the \"hauntings,\" and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail (where he died). Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger.\n",
       "As in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if she's not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often!\n",
       "\"GDoML\" features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore: Mallone's cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map (the one included in the game didn't help me much). That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancy's progress onscreen.\n",
       "One nifty feature was Nancy's PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types: numeric/dials/switches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an \"alarm clock\" setting to change from day to night since some tasks (and events) can only be completed then.\n",
       "Graphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done (the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs). The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple: all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360 rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters: in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lip-synching was really bad. In \"GDoML,\" at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun: in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearing-impaired players (a very nice touch), including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game \"The Haunted Carousel.\" Overall this is a nice introduction to the Nancy Drew series from Her Interactive and a fun mystery to solve with plenty of details and creepy moments.

In fact, I feel that it could have been better in so many ways.  Don't get me wrong.  The Nancy Drew games series is great.  In each game, you, as Nancy Drew, gather clues, interview people, solve puzzles, explore secret passages, and find the culprits.  The games are engaging, fun, and even educational.  And they're fun for both kids and adults alike.  The first game in the series, \"Secrets Can Kill,\" was well-intentioned but the character graphics (and the fact that you had to switch back and forth between two CDs) left much to be desired.  However, after \"Secrets,\" the games began to significantly improve.  You would think, then, that by the seventh game, the games would be stellar.  Not true.  I think they peaked at game three (\"Message in a Haunted Mansion\") and four (\"Treasure in a Royal Tower\").  It's almost as if, by game seven, the designers/creators have run out of ideas.  I don't mean for the plots -- I mean for puzzles, for character's wisecracks, that sort of thing.  Things that move the game along and make it fun.  Most every puzzle in \"Ghost Dogs\" was eerily similar to a puzzle we've seen in a previous Nancy Drew game, the only exception being the one you have to play when Nancy is in peril toward the middle of the game (this is not a spoiler; in just about every Nancy Drew game, Nancy is in peril about halfway through the game.)  That puzzle was fun.  But the others could have been better.  Also, in each Nancy Drew game there is some sort of educational element.  You learn things as you go along, from books, computers, newspaper articles, or signs.  But in this game, there was a HUGE amount of information on parks on one single computer.  Most of this information wasn't even important to the game.  Why is it there?  Who's going to sit there and read it?  With all due respect, I was just slightly bored with \"Ghost Dogs.\"  My last complaint (and I really don't mean to sound like a picky grouch; I love Nancy Drew, really, I do) is Nancy's personal data assistant that she carries with her now.  She puts all her clues in there.  She even carries maps around with her now!  One of the most fun things about the Nancy Drew games, for me, has been that you have to write down clues (on paper, in real life), trace maps, etc.  If I happen to not notice a clue in \"Ghost Dogs,\" well hey, Nancy (but I thought *I* was Nancy?) has already jotted it down for me.  And this was on the senior level!  I guess I could just NOT look at the PDA, but come on, it's too tempting.  Where's the challenge?  I really hope the next game will be better; from the promo, it looks very intriguing.  And I *do* have faith in the designers to make this next one a winner.  In conclusion, me just say this: if you've never played a Nancy Drew game before, you'd be safe to start with this one, since all the puzzle concepts would be new to you.  But it's not the best.  Still, if you're a Nancy Drew fan, it's still pretty amusing and so I give it 4 stars.</td><td>01 28, 2003</td><td>A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2</td><td>Molly P.</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Not the best Nancy Drew game there is</td><td>1043712000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The seventh in the series, these games are relatively inexpensive yet provide hours of gameplay.

       "You can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the 'snapshot' quality is more of a flow. It's still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go \"to\" a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a \"hot spot\" in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you can't click on something, it's not important.\n",
       "There's no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games I've lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs don't actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning.\n",
       "The game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons aren't in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if you're cleaning areas where mice live.\n",
       "There are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like you're really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world.\n",
       "On the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it.\n",
       "Still, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. It's not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have 'beaten it'. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, it's a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those \"little grey cells\" in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects.

At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process.

This is what computers have promised to deliver for some time now.  In this and other ways, Microsoft is finally bringing it to users in a usable, intuitive manner.\n",
       "Previous features such as spellchecking, grammar, integration and smart cut-copy-paste operations are all present.  Perhaps the best addition to the suite is Microsoft's OneNote, which promises to capture freeform notes and text in whatever way you like, digitizing tablet handwriting or keyboard entry; the killer app is how it recognizes the handwriting and indexes the text for finding your notes again.  Call it system-wide Graffiti for Windows.\n",

Microsoft's OneNote is good, maybe even killer, but you've gotten along without it for quite some time now, haven't you?\n",

The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.\n",

The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.\n",
       "Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.\n",
       "Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.\n",
       "Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with \"Clear Type\" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.\n",
       "PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.\n",
       "This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.\n",
       "Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great. Compatibility goes back to Publisher 2000, which is a draw back for users who might be using Publisher 98 or under.\n",

I've been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found I'm not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  It's extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: \"it's probably due to spyware\".  Well, I've been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didn't exist until I installed this upgrade).

It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.\n",

Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with \"Clear Type\" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.\n",

Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.\n",

The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.\n",

It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great.

       "As is the trend in software these days, Norton Antivirus 2004 will have to be \"activated\" either by the Internet or phone within 15 days of installation or it will stop working.\n",
       "Upon completion of the installation process Live Update will run and update the program with the latest program files and virus signatures.  Live Update will continue to run in the background (whenever you are on the Internet) in order to keep Norton Antivirus 2004 up to date.\n",
       "\n",
       "First Impressions:\n",
       "I am still impressed by this program.  As I stated above I have used Norton Antivirus for a number of years and I have grown to respect its functionality.  Symantec has fixed the once vexing problem that plagued earlier releases of Norton Antivirus, resource allocation, as the program had a tendency to consume more than its share.  This is no small issue since the program runs in the background.  However with the release of Norton Antivirus 2003, Symantec licked the resource issue, resulting in a much better functioning program.\n",
       "The sole purpose of an antivirus program is to protect your computer from viruses and this is where Norton Antivirus 2004 outshines the rest. Norton Antivirus 2004 protects your computer in the background in three primary ways:\n",
       "* Auto-Protect: protects your computer in the background by continuously monitoring system files for malicious code, including the boot sector, and memory.  Also checks files as they are downloaded from the Internet or from a floppy or other removable disk.  This option can be turn off.\n",
       "\n",
       "* Inbound & Outbound Email Scanning: as the title implies, Norton Antivirus 2004 integrates with your email program and automatically scans incoming and outgoing email, or can be set up to scan either.  In the case of outgoing mail a small box will pop up from the task bar indicating scan progress.  And incoming virus via an email will result in a popup box asking you what you want done with the offending code.  This option can be turn off.\n",
       "* Script Blocking: monitors script-based viruses like those encoded in emails of applets executed from the Internet, and alerts you to such behavior, stopping these viruses before they can infect your computer.  This option can be turn off.\n",
       "I utilize all three options because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and I continually receive email, both personal and professional.  Just today Norton Antivirus 2004 detected three viruses in spam sent to one of my email addresses.  To me, the program pays for itself the very first time it saves your computer from a malicious attack.\n",
       "Virus Scanning:\n",
       "Norton Antivirus 2004 can accomplish virus scanning manually or via scheduled events which you can control.  Manual scans can be accomplished at any time and the option exists to scan the following:\n",
       "* My Computer\n",
       "* Scan all removable drives\n",
       "* Scan all floppy disks\n",
       "* Scan drives\n",
       "* Scan folder\n",
       "* Scan files\n",
       "Custom scan jobs can also setup and run immediately, or scheduled to run at a later time.  I have setup the program to scan my network drives every Saturday night at 2:00 A.M. and my computer at the same time on Sunday, thereby freeing me from worrying about doing a complete scan on a regular basis.  Norton Antivirus 2004 does it for me!\n",
       "Conclusion:\n",
       "Virus protection has gone from a nice-to-have utility to a necessity that every computer connected to the Internet, or a network (work or home), or used jointly, cannot do without.  For me Norton Antivirus 2004 is the best anti-virus program on the market, and I highly recommend it.</td><td>11 17, 2003</td><td>A3QMJMTLJC34QC</td><td>Vincent E.

Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average.

       "PLOT: Nancy Drew is introduced to Marine Biologist Katie Firestone through a friend [Georgia Fayne] and a week of relaxation and vacation welcomes the lady detective! Well, you know that never works out especially when Katie is involved with controversy concerning a lone Orca that made its way onto the coast.  The whale isn't leaving and Kati's boat is sabotaged. Many reasons crop up? Was it because she won't sell out to a local tour company? Is it because she is intimately involved in whale correspondence?  Hmmmm.....[as ND would say].\n",

But, I guess she had nobody she trusted and it seemed it all happened in 24 hours [which is weird]. I didn't expect her to be the culprit at any point.\n",
       "\n",
       "Holt Scotto: For someone running for a political position such as Harbormaster, he can get pretty mouthy.  It's probably the sailor in him [ya know, you can never take the sailor out of the man....:) ].  I loved his personal quiz. Using the internet wasn't such a problem, but I was a little surprised on how much the game made me rely on it.  I'd have liked it if HER could have included a couple more local characters that provided that information through their life experiences. I know that HER doesn't flesh out it's character list with bodies that don't interact with Nancy directly, but it was also strange to hear the hustle and bustle of the Hot Kettle Cafe patronage when the place was vacant the entire adventure!\n",
       "\n",
       "Andy Jason: This guy gave me the chills.  He seemed a tool; was that it? Was it the \" Whale Rules!\" anthem he irritated me by? I don't know, but I had him as my # 1 culprit because the other characters just didn't fit the profile.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jenna Deblin: She really thought a lot about herself, but she knew how to cook! I had a chance to eat her muffins, but was never given another chance at them after the initial offering! I thought that was quite odd.\n",

I already knew about poker scoring and the plaque punch to earn a royal flush was just okay. The coordinates challenge really bothered a lot of reviewers, but I was fine with that whole system. In general, there was nothing that captured my fancy.\n",

       "ADVENTURE ENDING:  The new scenario aboard the ship was quite interesting although I wished I could have explored more aboard the deck.  I was happy to interact with the orca whale, but I always have the nervousness in the back of my mind what they can do to humans if they are angered.\n",

Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending).

       "Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:\n",
       "\n",
       "Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.\n",
       "\n",
       "Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.\n",
       "\n",
       "Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.\n",
       "\n",
       "Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.\n",
       "\n",
       "Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.\n",

       "Nancy's friends Bess and George have arranged a vacation for her. Nancy will be staying with Katie Firestone, a marine biologist friend of George's, in Snake Horse Harbor, Deception Island (one of the San Juan Islands off the cost of Washington state). Nancy is immediately greeted by Katie, who was just getting back to her houseboat from getting groceries. When the two make it back to the boat, they discover that it's been ransacked and vandalized. Could this be the latest work done by an unknown group that's been robbing shops around town? Not only that, but an orphaned killer whale has recently made home in the harbor surrounding the town, and seems to be hanging around all by itself for no apparent reason.  Just who did this to Katie? Who are these vandals and robbers? And what's the real deal with this orca? It's now up to Nancy to submerge herself into the dangers surrounding Snake Horse Harbor to find the truth...\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Danger on Deception Island\" employs amazing graphics. Even though this game is a bit older, several of the graphics in this game could rival those used in games today. The suspects look so realistic that they almost look like actual actors and actresses. The graphics seen while kayaking, exploring the town, and walking on the beaches are nothing short of beautiful. Some real (or at least, realistic) photos of sea life are also presented throughout game play, which is a definite bonus. I felt like I was actually walking through a town by the beach while playing this game, instead of just playing a game featuring one.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Danger on Deception Island\" has some of the best mini games, puzzles, and challenges that had been seen in Nancy Drew games upon its release. I especially enjoyed the mini games in Whale World (one of the explorable areas in the game). However, are several ways to die multiple times in this game (which doesn't bother me, but does some others), and one of the puzzles that involves getting a set of coordinates is very challenging and time-consuming. Aside from that puzzle, I can't complain at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "All of the characters had their quirks, but they were a pretty well-casted bunch. Every suspect fit the story rather nicely, and they all had moments when they looked like they could be the culprit. The culprit becomes rather shocking, as there are several clues that come up and point toward another character(s) at the end of the game, until the ultimate truth is revealed. I could hardly wrap my mind around the fact that this character was the guilty party, but it was definitely a very tasteful twist (though I still would've slightly preferred the culprit being somebody else).\n",
       "\n",
       "The first suspect met is Katie Firestone, who's a friend of George's and a marine biologist. She's pretty strong-willed, and definitely has some secrets that she's hiding from Nancy. Holt Scotto is an elderly fisherman who's running for harbor master, and doesn't particularly like Katie's defense of a policy that forces boats to stay several feet away from the whale (as he has to take the long way to get out to sea). Jenna Deblin is the owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and thinks Katie has a lot of secrets as to what she truly wants to do with the whale (i.e. study it instead of help it). Andy Jason is the owner of Whale World, a tourist attraction that specializes in educating visitors in facts about whales, and wants Katie to sell out to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "What really made the characters awesome was dialogue shared between Nancy and her phone friends. The conversations had with Bess and George and Frank and Joe Hardy were all very nicely scripted. Not a single one ever felt boring. The one-time phone friends were pretty memorable in their own ways too, such as Casey Porterfield (who constantly has a hard time understanding Nancy) and Hilda Swenson (she's so... well, I'll let you find out for yourself). The phone friends in this game were much better than the phone friends in several games were, and I would definitely like to see some of the one-timers make a second appearance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The musical score in this game was awesome, which could be said about every single game created before it. However, this game does have a bit more going for it musically, as it definitely goes out of its way to make itself unique. The game features a lot of songs that sounded like they belonged in a movie about sailors, or from a kid's special to educate children about the seas and those who travel them. I felt like it went out of its way to make itself more \"beachy\" than other soundtracks have to make themselves \"scarier\" or more \"royal\". The realistic sounds of waves, seagulls, and seals made the music all the more fitting.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, is Danger on Deception Island the best Nancy Drew game ever? I'd say it ranks among them. There are very few complains that I can make about this game, as nearly everything about it goes above and beyond. I would love to see Nancy re-visit Deception Island in a future case, as well as meet several of the characters she met here again. The game is *THAT* good!</td><td>06 27, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Fun on an Island of Dangerous Deception!</td><td>1309132800</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0000CEM5O</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I had VERY high expectations for this game, and I'm happy to say that it met all of them!

       "PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited to Snake Horse Harbor to go whale watching with Katie Firestone. But when Nancy gets there, she discovers Katie's boat has been vandalized. Somebody in Snake Horse Harbor is up to something illegal, and it's up to Nancy to figure who it is! I thought that the plot was excellent. It was really intriguing and had lots of twists and turns and really kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot was so unique and fun, it's a perfect example of just how awesome Nancy Drew games can be!\n",
       "\n",
       "CHARACTERS - 5/5: There was a good amount of characters in this game, and they all had incriminating evidence against them, so it was practically impossible to guess who the culprit was! There was Katie Firestone, a marine biologist who's nice, but virtually everyone in town hates her. Then there's Holt Scotto, and old school fisherman who's running for political office as Harbormaster. Jenna Dublin, who runs the local cafe and especially hates Katie. Then there's Andy Jason, who owns a whale museum and rivals Katie's whale watching tours. I think Andy was my favorite person to talk to because it was hilarious every time he said \"And remember...WHALES RULE!\" And, of course, there was the orca herself, who was very cute!\n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING - 5/5: The setting was really well done. I've been to Washington State, and this game captured exactly what the beaches look like there. It was foggy, but very beautiful. Plus, the cafe was friendly feeling and the stained glass was really pretty. The whale museum looked just like a real museum. Everything in this game was so realistic. And the music was really cheerful and nice, and it never got annoying or repetitive, which was great.\n",
       "\n",
       "PUZZLES - 5/5: The puzzles in this game were also wonderful. There was just enough so that you didn't feel like you were doing a puzzle every second, but you still always had something to do. Plus the puzzles were challenging, not so much that you get frustrated and want to quit, but just enough so that they're exciting and fun. That's another thing, the puzzles in this game were actually FUN, and as much as I enjoy this series, I can't say that a lot of the puzzles in the other games are fun. They're challenging, but not very much fun. But I can honestly say that I had a blast playing this game!\n",
       "\n",
       "IS IT CHALLENGING?: Yeah, it's just the right amount of challenge. It was hard, but not so hard that I got frustrated or tired of it. It was really just perfect, I'd give it a 4.5.\n",
       "\n",
       "ENDING - 5/5: The ending was so exciting. Snooping around, I really felt like I was in danger of being caught. Plus there was a big twist at the end in terms of revealing the culprit. I was surprised how scary the culprit got at the end, they just looked so evil! Catching them was fun, it took me a while to figure it out, but once I did I was very pleased. It was a fantastic ending to a fantastic game!\n",

       "Gameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.\n",

Pleased with so fine a product, I bought many over the years.  Certainly OS X (Panther) has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance.  But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before.  Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems.  I can now.  Before, I could find things.  And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders.  If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent.  I could see the folders open, one inside the other.  And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively.  No more.  In OS X, I haven't a clue.  I do have a 750-page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther.  With a trembling finger on the step-by-step instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully.  I know the red buttons close something-sometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window.  (Which I've learned to find after a brief but infuriating search.)  There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I can't say what they do just now.  It's all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason.  If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green?  Don't bother; logic is no guide in Panther.  And that encapsulates the problem.  In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized.  The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.  Try to console yourself with that tradeoff the next time you face the spinning beach ball of death.  Hint: Erase your hard-drive and re-install everything.  A rock after all is a rock.\n",

       "As the masses await the Fed-Ex truck to deliver to their eager hands a copy of the latest Mac OS X release from Apple, Panther, MyMac.com presents our early, first-look at the eagerly awaiting OS.\n",
       "First impressions: Wow, this thing is fast! Running 10.3 on an Apple Macintosh G5 1.8GHz, we noticed a huge speed boost to almost every finder-level task. Opening windows, scrolling large directories, accessing other machines over the network, you name it, it seemed faster. But lets take a look at some of the unique features in Panther.\n",
       "Expos&eacute;. This is a very, very cool new feature that I am simply in love with. What does it do? Well, for the uninitiated, it gives you instant access to any open window from any program, including the finder. What Expos&eacute; does is makes every open window shrink on your screen, and you simply click the window you want to spring to the front. So what's the big deal, you ask? Unlike the old Application window in Mac OS 9, which will only show you the applications running, this shows you all your open windows. So if you have three Safari windows open (I never do, I am in love with Tabs now) this will let you see every window. What's more, when you put your cursor over the mini-windows, the name of the window is displayed. You really have to experience Expos&eacute; live to appreciate just how much it is going to change the way you use the Mac OS. The only drawback for me is that it does not show any windows you may have minimized to the dock.\n",
       "To access Expos&eacute;, you first set it up in your system preferences pane. For myself, I have Expos&eacute; activate for all windows if I put my cursor in the upper-right hand of my screen. If I put my cursor in the lower right, only the front application (including the Finder) will show. By default, three F-Keys are also set to do the same. Even cooler, when you click F11, all open windows move out of the way to reveal the desktop, and stay out of the way until you call them back.\n",
       "If you have a multi-button mouse, you can also assign mouse buttons to do the same. I personally use my extra mouse buttons to launch applications, but I could set it up so that the scroll wheel button moves everything out of the way for quick access to the desktop.\n",
       "Expos&eacute; is one of those application that, like I said, better experienced than explained. I cannot get over how useful this is to how I would with my Mac. If it were not part of the OS, I would call this the next Killer App for the Mac.\n",
       "Heads-up Application Switcher. This is yet another way to switch between applications without using Expos&eacute; or the Dock. Mac OS 9 also had it. All you do is hold down the command-tab keys to bring up a heads-up display of the open applications. You continue to hold down the command (Apple) key while you \"Tab\" to the application you want. I used the same method in Mac OS 9 for years, and fell in love with it. It is one of the most missed features for me in Mac OS X.\n",
       "Welcome Back Labels! Yes, you can, finally, use labels in Mac OS X. But this, my friends, is labels on steroids! Labels work in all three views, Icons, List, or Columns. In Icon view, the label is a rich full color, rounded around the text. The icon itself is not colored, as it was is Mac OS 9. In List view, the color again does not apply to the icon, but to the entire line of the item labeled, so that the rounded colored bar extends across the entire windows. The same is true for Column view, but when you have clicked the labeled folder, the triangle keeps the label color. These may seem like not such a big deal, but they really are. Many, many people used labels to help find items, or to mark items that are of special importance, and it is a much-welcomed re-introduction to the Mac OS. Like Expos&eacute;, you really have to see the new labels in action to appreciate them.\n",
       "Many people are all up in arms about the brushed metal look, which is used in all the iLife applications, now being carried throughout the finder as well. These worries are unfounded, in my opinion. While I actually like the look, you can toggle it off if you wish. You do, however, loose some of the new functionality of finder windows if you do. Rather than having application folders, favorite folders, document folder etc&Eacute; at the top of each window, they are all now on the far left of your open windows. And they are all customizable. Personally, I think the new windows in Panther are a welcome improvement over the previous OS X windows.\n",
       "One neat, though small, new feature is Apple put the often-used \"Software Update\" in the Apple menu. Clicking this simply opens the Software Update pane, but it does save one step in the process. A small update, sure, but one I have already gotten used to. And as the Apple menu is unchanged system-wide, you are always one click away from it.\n",
       "Fast Switching. What is this? Well, if you share your computer with others, you will probably want to have multiple users accounts set up. A staple since the first release of Mac OS X, it was easy to switch to a different user. Now, however, it is even faster. When you activate \"Enable Fast User Switching\" in the \"Accounts\" pane in System Preferences, it puts the current users name in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It also puts in all the other names of any other user of your Mac. In my case, I have a \"Basic\" in which the system is basically as it would be fresh from the store. I also have one for my wife (even though she uses her own iMac, not my G5) and one named \"Kids\" which is for, obviously, my kids. (All they can do is create pictures in Illustrator or Photoshop, type up letters, and use Safari with bookmarks my wife and I approve, all others all deleted.)\n",
       "So what happens when you click one of those names? You entire screen rotates; bring that user to the front. If the name is password protected, in brings up the log-on screen. And best of all, you can leave your account just as it is, with all the applications running, and switch users. When you switch back, everything is just as you left it. This is amazing technology I don't think enough people utilize.\n",
       "All in all, Panther is a great OS. Of course, there will be some applications that will not run correctly and need updating, but that is true for any major OS upgrade. I am very, very pleased with Mac OS X 10.3, and think that for those with a newer machine, you will appreciate the added speed benefits and stability. The new features all work really well, and I look forward to delving deeper into Panther in the coming months.\n",

Yes the system is quicker and there are some useful features such as expose, but I'm not sure it was worth the cost of the upgrade.\n",
       "If Apple is planning on upgrading OS X every year then I probably could have gone along with 10.2.8 with no complaints and done a upgrade on the next version. I think Apple should have offered a upgrade version for those with 10.2 for about half the cost of what is charged for Panther. To pay full price for a OS  you expect major changes, like from Windows 98 to Windows XP.\n",

       "Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n",

       "Green Power Use:\n",
       "The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n",
       "\n",
       "Support:\n",
       "I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Conclusions:\n",
       "The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n",
       "\n",
       "The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n",
       "\n",
       "I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.\n",
       "\n",
       "I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.\n",

       "This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unpacking\n",
       "\n",
       "The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n",
       "\n",
       "Installation\n",
       "\n",
       "You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hardware\n",
       "\n",
       "All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n",
       "\n",
       "One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n",
       "\n",
       "Software\n",
       "\n",
       "The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n",
       "\n",
       "I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n",
       "\n",
       "A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n",
       "\n",
       "Features\n",
       "\n",
       "The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n",
       "\n",
       "During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Bad\n",
       "\n",
       "The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n",
       "\n",
       "Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00.

I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.

But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.

Mary Yazzi is the first Native American character to appear in a Nancy Drew game, and she runs her own store on land adjacent to Shadow Ranch. They all fit together nicely, and the amount of interaction they have with Nancy is not only exceptional, but also the interaction they have with each other. Nearly all of them have something to say about each other, and we get to really understand how they get along with each other as well as with Nancy.

       "PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is invited to Shadow Ranch, which belongs to Bess and George's aunt and uncle, the Rawleys.. But when she gets there, Bess and George are a no-show, and the Rawleys are in the hospital after Mr. Rawley got bitten by a rattlesnake. Nancy then learns that a mysterious glowing horse has been making nightly appearances at the ranch, and that everytime it shows up, a freak accident happens. She also learns about a outlaw named Dirk Valentine who, in the 1800's, was in love with a girl who lived on Shadow Ranch, and supposedly left her a hidden treasure somewhere. Could Dirk Valentine's treasure have something to do with the horse? Is there really a treasure? Who will stop the horse before something really bad happens? Well, it's up to you, as Nancy Drew!\n",
       "\n",
       "This is practically the same plot as Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon (I guess it would be the other way around, cause this game came out first, but I played Last Train first so it's backwards for me) so it didn't really catch my attention. The plot was executed pretty well, though, but I still prefer Last Train. Everyone says how much fun the horseback riding was, but I didn't think it was that cool. You just point and click, same as always, except theres a horse head in front of you. But I will admit that by the end of the game, my horse Bob and I were pretty tight.\n",
       "\n",
       "CHARACTERS - 4/5: The characters were good in this game. They weren't really THAT much fun to talk to (except Bess and George), but some of them were intersting. Tex is the horse wrangler guy, he's tough, mean, down-right scary looking, and he doesn't have much to say. Mary Yazzie owns the gift store near the ranch, her character was boring and her voice was really annoying. The cook, Shorty, was nice, it was funny how he always wanted to gossip with Nancy, but I thought he was creepy looking, like a big scary teddy bear. The foreman, Dave, was quiet, but it was really sweet how he had a crush on Nancy. And Charleena wasn't that cool cause all you did was talk to her on the phone. Overall, I think they did a good job on the characters, they weren't amazing, but the voice acting was good (except Mary IMO) and the graphics for them were also good.\n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING - 4.5/5: This game is set in Arizona, and I think that the makers of this game did a great job getting that desert feeling. The decorations in the house were just perfect, and the ranch looked so realistic. The ghost town was pretty spooky, and the desert was barren, as it should be. The only problem I had with the setting was the music! The song was good at first but then it just got really annoying and repetitive. I would give the setting a 5 but for the song I'm gonna have to knock off half a point.\n",
       "\n",
       "PUZZLES - 2/5: If you were to ask me what was the ONE thing that bothered me about this game, I wouldn't hesitate a second to say CHORES!!! I hated them! Fixing the wire and collecting the eggs wasn't so bad, but picking those vegetables, AHHH! I got sent home like 20 times for picking unripe vegetables. I mean really, who sends a guest home for picking an unripe tomato? I ended up printing out like a map of the garden from a walkthrough so that I knew which vegetables to pick. But those chores were just a total turn off. I felt like some of the other puzzles in the game were also hard, I spent like an hour trying to do that impossible magnet thing, then another hour hunting for arrowheads on the ground. It was just ridiculous. I don't know, mabye there were some really fun puzzles in this game, but I can't remember them cause all I remember is that awful garden. The puzzles in this game are really not my cup of tea.\n",
       "\n",
       "IS IT CHALLENGING?: YES! Unless if your an expert at collecting vegetables, baking cakes, spending hours searching the ground for arrowheads, and solving invisible puzzles. I'd give it a 5/5 for challenge, but it's not challenging in a fun way.\n",
       "\n",
       "ENDING - 4/5: The ending is good. The maze at the end is confusing, definitely challenging. And if it weren't for a walkthrough I wouldn't have ever guessed how to catch the culprit. I was kind of surprised by who the culprit was and what their motive was. Overall the ending was good.\n",

To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, \"dual category lists\", \"in-register\" spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone.  What have they been replaced with?  I have no clue.  As far as I can tell, they've replaced them with a HUGE toolbar (a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize) and a LOT of white space (the register displays about 30 lines max (on \"compressed\" view) and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen.)\n",

       "On the first problem, Money 2005 uses just one combined category-subcategory list, so when you enter a transaction, you must choose a category-subcategory from one big list.

Evidently, something on my computer will occassionally cause the email scanning to not load properly, so if it showed 'ERROR' - I would have to reboot and then it would be ok.  I should point out that Norton Support Staff told me even though email scanning said 'error', the computer is still protected by the 'auto-protect' feature if it is turned on.

For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security.

       "PLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.\n",
       "\n",
       "Like I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.\n",
       "\n",
       "CHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.\n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.\n",
       "\n",
       "PUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.\n",

The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.\n",

They live together in Blackmoor Manor, where the Penvellyns have lived for hundreds of years. However, shortly after she moves in, Linda begins to feel sickly and starts behaving bizarrely. She throws fits, hides behind a bed curtain all day, and refuses to eat healthy food. Nobody knows what's caused this change in her, and in a fit of desperation, her mom (who still lives in America) calls Nancy to ask her if she could fly out to England to find out what's happening to Linda.\n",

       "Once she arrives in Blackmoor Manor, Nancy hears a sinister-sounding creature call out her name. When she looks around, she sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at her. Mrs. Drake, an elderly woman who's been taking care of the manor, answers the door, but not before the creature leaves. Mrs. Drake seems skeptical of what Nancy claims to have seen, but that doesn't stop Nancy from investigating. She soon discovers that one of the Penvellyns to own Blackmoor Manor was burned at the stake for witchcraft hundreds of years ago, and a beast she's rumored to have created had been prowling the moors for years. Could this beast have now returned? And why? And what (if anything) does it have to do with Linda? The answers to all these questions and more can only be found by solving this case...\n",

This is the first time when she's not called in to investigate high-profile crimes, like murder, threats, vandalism, kidnapping, theft, and the like. \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" is also the first game to feature a family struggle that's turned into a mystery that Nancy is now called to solve. I enjoyed this plot quite a bit, and felt it was quite refreshing.\n",

       "Blackmoor Manor is beautifully detailed. The graphics used in this game are superb, and even though it was released way back in 2005, the gaming quality and graphics still rival many games today.

       "This game featured A LOT of puzzles, but they were all very well-explained and served a purpose for being there. I liked them all, and even though others might complain, I personally cannot. I also liked exploring the manor, which is rather large and has many places and things to see. My sole complaint is that at least half of the exploration takes place in the secret passageways, and I would've liked to see more of the \"outer surface\" of Blackmoor Manor.\n",
       "\n",
       "There were also lots of fun mini games to play, so the player can find something else fun to do in the game if they're bored with solving puzzles and want to take a break from the mystery.

All of them have to be played at least once to progress the game in some way, but they can all be played again as much as the player wants to (Jane's always up for play!).\n",

       "All of the characters were very well-developed, and all had reason for being at the manor while Nancy was staying there. They also all had something to benefit by causing the haunting and horror surrounding Blackmoor Manor, and for terrorizing poor Linda. The first suspect met is Mrs. Drake, Hugh's aunt with a self-righteous attitude and believes the British to be superior to the Americans in every way. Nigel Mookerjee is a historian who's been hired by Mrs. Drake to write a book on the Penvellyns, and is looking for something in the family history to \"spice things up\" for his book. Jane Penvellyn is Hugh's 12-year-old daughter who's been forced to return to the manor after living in the United States for awhile, and seems to miss her biological mother very much. Ethel Bosinny is Jane's private tutor who only appears every so often, and is very elusive and mysterious in the sense that she never seems to be found in the same place twice (nor can when she'll appear be predicted).\n",

       "The other characters and phone friends are all pretty nicely integrated too. I absolutely loved the fact that Nancy can call Ned again (as he hadn't appeared in a game since \"The Final Scene\"), and the new method of getting hints that this game employed was very unique and fun. Rather than getting her hints from her phone friends, Nancy consults with Loulou, an 80-year-old female parrot who's residing in the manor. Loulou is very smart, and has quite a lot of funny comments to make about the case and everything involved. She's very well-scripted, and I loved talking to her because of how much comedic relief she added to the game.\n",

But out of frustration I took Norton off of my computer and VOIL my problems went away! I couldn't believe it. No more computer crashes, no more slovenly performance, no more hanging up on shutdown and interminable startup times.\n",
       "\n",
       "I was then confronted with finding another program to supplant Norton. I searched Cnet and came up with PC-Cillin! This program works great. I does not degrade performance one iota! No hanging up on shutdown or interminable startup times. This program works silently in the background and is literally updated daily in 3 - 5 seconds. I couldn't possibly be more pleased.\n",
       "\n",
       "The firewall in this program seems to work OK - I am unable to appreciate a significant difference from my free version of Zone Alarm.  Spam control implementation is very clumsy, as are most other programs, and it would seem it will be awhile until we get a seamless elegant spam control solution, at least from Trend Micro.  Spyware is certainly no better than Ad-aware.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the life of me I cannot understand how a company as distinguished as Symantec could fritter away all their goodwill and reputation by putting out a program that is quite simply awful.  I'm glad to be saying goodbye to Norton and its memory and system resource busting program.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the end of the day the cornerstone of any security suite is going to be the anti-virus program.  PC Cillin's anti-virus program is second to none.  The rest of the suite is good, but not necessarily the best and the free programs from Zone Alarm and Ad-Aware are, IMO, better.  My recommendation, go with the PC Cillin anti-virus program and forget the suite.\n",
       "\n",
       "Do yourself a favor. Forget Norton and McAffee. PC-Cillin anti-virus is incomparably better. My computer, for the first time in 18 months, works like it was brand new responding instantaneously to all commands and starting up and shutting down quickly and efficiently.</td><td>01 11, 2005</td><td>A3IPSECQAUAT8V</td><td>JanSobieski</td><td>null</td><td>Anti-virus is the BEST!

Hello Trend Micro.</td><td>1104192000</td><td>false</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>B00068IBZW</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I will preface this review by saying that I purchased the 2004 edition just 3 days before the 2005 edition was released, but Trend did me right and gave me a free upgrade. That's a plus right out of the starting gate.\n",
       "\n",
       "I originally switched to Trend from Norton after having slowdowns and resource shortages. Norton is very large and very slow, but by and large it worked for me. I was hesitant to make the switch, but I decided to do it anyway and see how Trend's product works. I have not been disappointed. First off, the memory footprint for this package is about half that of Norton when everything is turned on. For me, that's important - Norton takes up huge amounts of memory and slows the system down, where Trend takes up less room and seems to be a lot faster at execution time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trend has always had a very fast and very effective antivirus. This latest version is no exception. However, where this package seems to shine most brightly in the antivirus arena is in the timeliness of pattern file updates. Less than a week after the release of a particular email virus, Trend caught it arriving in my inbox and terminated it before it could do anything. To have a pattern for a brand new virus and already be able to handle it is a very, very good thing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The firewall itself is quite effective and it seems to do its job very efficiently. Where it tends to bother people is in the fact that it is a very quiet firewall and it does not notify for every little thing like Norton or ZoneLabs do. This may or may not agree with you, but for me I'm content that it's working in the background and isn't bothering me with every little thing that happens.\n",
       "\n",
       "The spyware detection feature seems to have come of age, and even after running SpyBot S&D and Ad-Aware, it still found spyware on my system. It did a good job cleaning up and it did everything very fast and efficiently.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are a couple of things I cannot test, as I am on dialup. There are new network protection features that allow remote security administration for systems on the network running Trend's suite, and there is also a neat feature that loooks for intruders on wireless networks. Considering that cybersquatting on wireless networks is very common, this is an important feature that should be in all security suites. If you are running a wireless network, this feature will be invaluable.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trend includes a parental control feature in its suite, and it works in a fashion similar to Norton's and ZoneLab's equivalents. You pick your categories to block, and you're done. However, there is a flaw in their implementation - the blocking only seems to work with MS Internet Explorer. So, if you use Mozilla/FireFox or Opera, you're out of luck if you want to use the URL blocking.\n",
       "\n",
       "There is also an antispam feature, but it is not going to prevent spam from arriving in your inbox. Rather, it simply flags questionable messages as spam in the subject at delivery. This can help with sorting and disposal, but it will not keep it from being delivered. In my opinion, spam should never reach the email client if you have an antispam solution in place, so I regard this particular feature as ineffective. I suppose it is better than nothing, though, and many users will find it helpful - I don't. I didn't like Norton's, either, which works the same way.\n",
       "\n",
       "One interesting feature that Trend sports is \"Outbreak Notification\" which is used to alert users when a new, high-risk threat is circulating. Users will get a notification when a new high-profile virus is spreading, and that can be helpful if you're relying on manual updates.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trend Micro has put together a winner in their 2005 edition of their PC-Cillin Internet Security suite. It does not lack any major features, and the majority of the things they have included are very good and very effective. There are a few soft spots, but these are not critical to system security, and overall Trend is quickly catching up to the \"big boys.\" If you want a fast, small-footprint security solution that competes very competently with the likes of Norton, ZoneLabs and McAfee, Trend is an excellent contender.</td><td>11 18, 2004</td><td>A34VRVI4CSI5RQ</td><td>Matt Morgan</td><td>null</td><td>Excellent Security Suite, But Not Perfect</td><td>1100736000</td><td>false</td><td>420</td></tr><tr><td>B00068IBZW</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>***\n",

       "\n",
       "Fans of the application should not measure their success against this warning.  Your experience does not negate mine; I freely admit the program may work in your circumstances, but all potential buyers should see that PC-Cillin is far from perfect.\n",

       "Based on c|net's review, I gave this a try, and could not get it to run without spawning a blue screen error (specifically the STOP 0x0000001D and 0x0000000A errors).  This error was traced back to the firewall network driver of the package, and can only be fixed by uninstalling the software.  For those of you with a technical background, the firewall is hooking into the kernel using an outdated technique (AtGuard used to use the same technique).\n",
       "\n",
       "Technical notes: installed via web download and purchase (very easy to do, kudos to Trend Micro), onto a WinXP Pro machine (Dell Dimension 4500).  Plenty of space, definitely enough RAM and a fast enough Pentium 4 CPU.  System was recently patched to SP2.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Trend Micro addresses that issue, I will be able to go over the feature set in more depth.  At this point, however, I cannot recommend the product to anyone who needs a 100% reliable installation the first time.  For that, I would recommend McAfee 9.0.  While it might use more CPU cycles than most, it will install and not crash your PC.\n",

This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.

I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n",

The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen.

So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\n",

       "2. The Dolby Digital 5.1 feature allows you to fully control your project so you can offer enhanced sound, booting the overall quality. This is a fantastic addition for amateur and work-man level student film-makers on a budget.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Very easy editing tools that are `smart' and perfect for the user that has never edited anything in their life, allowing them to create pro-sumer level presentations. A lot of these programs typically assume that the user has a basic amount of working knowledge.\n",

       "1. I found performance different over three different computers that have very similar, but yes, different hardware. If you don't have 2 GB's of RAM Memory AT LEAST, then this program is going to struggle and probably crash on you frequently. I have a computer with 4 GB of RAM and it rendered the HD content without error but over many hours. AT 2GB of RAM it became a nightmare and I experienced lock-ups and had to not touch the computer once I started to render and turn off all power-saving functions on my computer so that it wouldn't crash. My 1.6 GB RAM Computer constantly crashed and I had to switch to using the DVD Wizard in order to create a project ... which just isn't the same.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The 2000K bit-rate limit of MP4 files is absolutely hideous. Breaking your video down into smaller files and then splicing them together is no fun and a bad compromise.\n",

       "3. Too much emphasis on very lame and kiddie-grade filters, frames and other features that I feel bog this product down with pedantic utilities that are better left to other programs that focus on use by children and those not trying to do something novelty like a Spongebob presentation.\n",

       "Other than that, Sony's Vegas Video 8 is a nice substitute, but if you've already made the leap into the program, or company, then with a little tinkering and some dedication you could make some very nice looking student level films and projects.\n",

The benefit and the beauty is participating with other classmates and going over the material in a setting that can also build your confidence. Learning at home alone, with a set of headphones doesn't really give you this, even though you may walk away with some sound basics. If you're going to study this over the summer and then concentrate on a double semester course in Chinese, you'll probably excel and be the star student.

Well, by buying an older version, there are no surprises as regards what Office can and can't do, because it's been around for however many years it's been since the date the version in question (Office 2007 Home and Student, which is 7 years as of when I write this) was made.\n",

OneNote is fully featured, and it along with PowerPoint have the caveat that they're for home or student use.

Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!\n",

How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?\n",

I have tested the restore methods, and not only are they reliable, but they are fast too. In case you try to restore a file that already exists, you will be prompted by Windows to confirm the restore, which should help prevent overwriting a good file by accident.

       "1) It makes installing Windows a fun and \"fearless\" experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the past, I have always used Apple's Bootcamp (a competing product) to run Windows on my Macbook Pro (2.4 GHz with 4 GB of RAM).  Only problem is that Apple's Bootcamp program can be a \"little confusing\" to use -- and when I first went to install Windows on my new Mac, I apparently didn't read the technical installation manually as carefully as I should of, and accidentally wound up wiping out my machine to the point that it wouldn't start.  Oh oh...  Not good!  ;-)  I eventually got it back up and running, with Windows installed on it, but it really wasn't the most user-friendly way of installing Windows on my Mac!\n",

       "However, with the introduction of VMware's Fusion 2, the process of installing Windows just became a real snap!  When I first started the program, it asked me if I would like to install Windows on my computer.  I said yes and it prompted me to insert my Windows installation disc into the drive.  The moment that I did this, it took control over the installation and after a bit, I have Windows freshly installed on my computer!  (Also, for those of you who want to use your Bootcamp partition, they give you the option of simply using it, or even migrating it directly to your Mac, as a virtual drive -- which helps to free up tons of space on your drive!)  It works seamlessly...\n",

       "\n",
       "This is one seriously cool feature of VMware Fusion 2.  Since Windows is running virtually on your machine, it means that you can unify both your Microsoft Office applications and your Mac programs together as one powerful software suite.  Fusion 2 comes with a feature called \"Unify\" that allows me to start up my Mac contacts and Microsoft Excel at the same time.  I can exchange information between these programs simply by using \"copy and paste\"!  Also, unlike Apple's Bootcamp software, I don't have to reboot my system every time that I want to use a program from the other OS.  This makes both me and my Mac more productive!\n",

       "If you already have Windows installed and running on your computer, Fusion 2 gives you the ability to run it virtually.  When I ran Windows XP virtually for the first time, Windows immediately deactivated both the operating system and my copy of Microsoft Office.  Also, Adobe Creative Suite CS2 immediately deactivated too, which was not good.  To fix this, I had to reactivate my products, which means that you may have to spend some time on the phone waiting for customer service to give you permission to re-use your software again.\n",

I have a USB hard drive connected to my Macbook Pro and while it's connected, it actually prevents Windows XP from being able to successfully boot.  To fix this problem, simply disconnect the drive (during the booting process) and everything will work fine!\n",

Most drawing programs with this level of functionality either require someone to teach it to you, or to take a college class, or even a buy a training book before you can truly master its functionality.

I do genealogy and among my projects is a detailed transcription of family letters in book format with photographs and images interspersed among the text along with complex uses of headings and footnotes.  When converting between different programs, headings, picture placement, etc will be changed due to the nature of how different programs format documents.

I love the category feature that lets you subdivide spending into categories. I has helped me realize that I really need to stop going out to eat so much. Joking aside, Quicken does a great job with tracking spending and it makes it super easy. This is truly one of the great parts about Quicken and has been for years.\n",

Quicken provides no way to separate that account from my own accounts, which means that in my budgeting and spending graphs, that account's activity shows up.  Quicken does provide away to exclude it from your \"Net Worth\" on the main page, but it does not separate it from your spending and income reports.

As one who's taken a few language courses in my time, I can say that while book study has its uses, to actually learn a language for practical use, speaking and hearing it is absolutely vital.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rosetta Stone attempts to get as close to that experiance as possible with its teaching style. Do do this, it uses images, spoke words and a return responce method. The user speaks into a microphone to respond and the program has the facility to \"listen\" to one's pronunciation and correct it when off.  For a tonal language such as Japanese, pronunciation is absolutely vital to avoid translation errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Rosetta Stone method is quite effective in helping to train a person's mouth to make the correct sounds and get used to saying the words. Japanese is a language quite unlike English, so this is a real benefit of the program. I found that it really did work in helping me retain vocabulary, though I did struggle at times.  The progam is fairly well designed from a flow standpoint, with various lessons occasionally repeating themselves as you progress to help reinforce retention of the material.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the end it's not a perfect method, but for the self studier, it isn't terrible.  The down side is that Rosetta stone uses a call responce method and so a person does not get the conversational experiance that builds confidence and teaches in its own right. Practical conversation is unexpected and fluid, something that a computer program cannot emulate. I could see that this program would be a godsend if used in conjunction with actual classes where one could practically apply what they've learned. Repeating rote phrases is a lot different than actually speaking.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another thing I noticed is that Rosetta Stone's focus on speaking actually has a downside in that it seems a bit weak on teaching proper grammer. It uses the language method of teaching by showing differences in gender and verb conjugations and the like as you go through lessons, but it's not very deep and a lot of it is inferred. For someone like myself who has taken numerous language classes over the years, I was left wondering if learning vocabulary and grammer in this way was really enough. Given that all I know about Japanese is what I was taught by Rosetta Stone, it's hard for me to say.\n",
       "\n",
       "The use of Japanese characters is another aspect of this program that threw me. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers here and studied some of the Hiragana on my own to avoid using Romaji (latinized written japanese). It was good advice.\n",
       "\n",
       "A word to the wise, this is a pretty in depth program. While commercials and the like seem to imply that this is the \"easy\" way to learn a language, it's like any other method of learning a language. It's work and a real investment of time. Daily study will make this program its most effective and probably push a student deeper into the language than basic classes would.  But it's likely to take months rather than weeks to progress to the point where one has a deeper grasp of the language.\n",
       "\n",
       "I didn't use the language CD's (which cover the lessons in the program), but I could see that if someone was in a hurry to learn even more quickly, these might be quite useful for usewhile in the car on the go.\n",

I do genealogy and among my projects is a detailed transcription of family letters in book format with photographs and images interspersed among the text along with complex uses of headings and footnotes.  When converting between different programs, headings, picture placement, etc will be changed due to the nature of how different programs format documents.  This essentially has limited me to using Word on my desktop. I've tried several editing suites, including Open Office.  All were a bust.\n",

       "I majored in German and also studied a lot of Spanish, so I am familiar with the various teaching methods.  Their method is a good mix, since it works on all six main areas of language: reading, writing, speaking, aural comprehension, grammar and vocabulary.\n",

       "\n",
       "The user interface could use some improvement.  It took several hours for me to stumble on how to do the crosswords and Audio Comprehension questions.  For crosswords, after you type in a word you have to click the \"solution\" icon, a lightbulb in the upper right corner.  It then gives you the next word. Normal reaction is that you would only click the solution icon if you just don't have a clue and NEED the answer rather than HAVE the answer. For the Audio Comprehension questions, after you select the answer you also have to click the solution icon so the progress report will show you have completed that task.\n",
       "\n",
       "There is one incredibly annoying thing with the crosswords ... the program distinguishes between accented and unaccented words that have the exact same pronunciation.  So, for instance, if you type l instead of el or t instead of tu (or vice versa) it considers it an error. They don't say \"el -- article\" or \"l - pronoun\".  You just have to guess!\n",
       "\n",
       "I DID NOTICE ONE SIGNIFICANT ERROR -- THEY GOT THE ALPHABET WRONG! Spanish has four letters that don't exist in English: ch, ll,  and rr.  For instance, chico has four letters, not five.  They don't list the ch or ll letters. As you go in further they eventually provide a LIST of the 29 letters. [Should be 30.  I originally said there were 3 extra letters and recently noticed the error.  I haven't used the program in awhile, so I don't know whether it shows 29 or 30.] But, by that time you are already used to thinking \"say -- ache -- ee -- say -- o\" (Chico) instead of \"chay -- ache -- say -- o\").  Also, you can't input the extra letters, which reinforces the error.  (They DO have clickable options for accented vowels and .)\n",

       "The \"practice a phoneme\" drills do have animated graphics giving a basic idea of placement of the tongue, etc.  However, they use technical terminology only someone with linguistics training would know.  (Where is the alveolar ridge?)  Also, at least the diagram for t is wrong.  It describes an English t, where the tongue does not touch the teeth.  A Spanish t is a dental sound, meaning the tongue touches the back of the top teeth.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the written portions, the program does distinguish non-English characters such as , ,  and  to force proper spelling but does not accept such characters from the United States-International keyboard layout.  Therefore, every time you have to input such a character you have to pick it from a chart with the mouse instead of just inputting it from the keyboard with right-alt plus the letter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The program is also mouse-intensive. When you finish a question you can't just press Tab or Enter to move to the next screen, you have to go to the upper right hand and click the Next button.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but it does quickly become annoying.\n",
       "\n",
       "From what I have seen so far, having worked through the first disk, this is really not a program for someone who just wants to learn a little Spanish for vacation travel. It puts quite a bit of emphasis on proper word order, spelling (including proper letter accents), and even punctuation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because of the way lessons are broken down, you can repeatedly access a particular section and get repeated variations.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are a few simple things it should mention early on that would make learning spelling and pronunciation much easier for beginners.  For instance, it could mention that Spanish is almost 100% phonetic. Also, that the voice accent goes on the final syllable but on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable if the word ends in a vowel or n or s, and in ANY multi-syllable word that does not follow that pattern you have to write an accent, e.g., seis but diecisis; nmero; sbado.  Also that pronouns get accents and adjectives/articles don't: he = l, you = t, but el = the and tu = your.  Also that question words get accents and non-question adverbs (etc.) don't: Where are you = dnde? but I know where = donde, How are you = cmo? but this s LIKE that\" = como, etc.\n",
       "\n",
       "Judging from the demo, this program is EXTREMELY customizable.  There are six major categories and you can select which ones you want, ratios, etc.  For instance, if you are primarily interested in being able to read you could set it to emphasize that rather than speaking and aural comprehension. Judging from descriptions from professional reviewers, Tell Me More seems to be the \"Rolls Royce\" of language-learning programs.  Although I have only been using it a short while and am just starting to get a good idea of the features, I think I would agree.  (My undergrad major was languages and linguistics, I spent a year in a Ph. D. program in linguistics and German, and I have studied German, Yiddish, Spanish, French, Russian, biblical Hebrew, Latin, and English linguistics and I have about 90 semester hours in various foreign language courses at the post-secondary school level.)\n",

       "The Nuance voice recognition is VERY good and doesn't require \"training\" the program. It can pick up the difference, for instance, between aspirated (the puff of breath with English initial p) and unaspirated p and dental (Spanish) versus (English) alveolar t.

       "\n",
       "An important point regarding voice-recognition sentence practice: It expects you to pronounce each word separately.

The main menu bar has the Elements color scheme for both options.  I find the menu text a bit small to read comfortably (24\" monitor at arm's length).  In X4/X5, although the type size was the same, with the Light Gray workspace scheme the menu was black text on a medium gray background, which stands out a lot better.  Perhaps with an update they'll add back the other two color schemes and change the main menu bar in the Light Gray workspace. When cursoring over a Main Menu option it does change to black text on gray and the various drop-down menus are black on gray.\n",

Double-clicking directly on the C:\\Program Files\\Corel\\Corel PaintShop Pro X[whatever]\\Corel PaintShop Pro.exe file would usually work.

The interface is pretty NON-intuitive--ALL icons, NO drop-downs or text-labelled buttons and no Help. It basically lets you change skin color, eye color, AND EXPRESSION. No change hair color, etc. In the Select Expression screen (Ctrl+4), if you click the button at the lower right next to Keep Result it shows thumbnails of the person with each expression applied. Click on a thumbnail and the After image will change. The altered expression can be exaggerated, so the Expression Strengh slider can be used to reduce the effect. The \"Expression\" can include things like changing the nose width (e.g., Elegant), not just lip and eye position. If you do a lot of portrait touch-up you'll probably want something like Portrait Professional instead.\n",

Not wanting to appear overly eager to dive in with the tech-rescue I suggested tax prep software and letting me have a go at it.  He mulled it over and said OK, so I then started reading reviews; deciding to go with H&R based upon the positives I'd read.\n",

       "I had not completed my own taxes for over 25 years, so I was a tad intimidated by the prospect of doing them at all. Fortunately my experience with last year's H&R software was very positive, and left me feeling empowered, not fearful that I'd done it incorrectly.\n",

If I don't have the info it's recommended to estimate earnings and taxes on the forms, but then after e-filing taxes, that info can quickly be uploaded to replace estimates. Yet another reason that e-filing is the way to go.\n",

It asks you questions and if you don't know the answer it offers help as to where to locate the information and tries to clarify information as needed. H&R also offers help to users via unlimited online chat with tax experts. You can work on part of your return and then save it to come back to it. It's a process that could take months or a few hours depending upon how complicated your return is and whether or not you have all the required information.\n",

       "\n",
       "According to the software the next update will be January 7th. Updates are fairly frequent, but the software offers to check for one each time you open it so you're never out of date. You also are asked what state return you wish to file, and this too is updated as needed.\n",

       "While a tad daunting at first (because I didn't want to mess anything up...) this software does a great job at guiding the user to a successful conclusion. It explains things in effective detail so the user feels informed versus overwhelmed. The logical progression of needed information in the software makes it easier for users who are unfamiliar with doing their own taxes to gather the needed information and have it at their fingertips to add to the software. Filing both the federal and state returns is done easily, and error checking (accuracy review) is done multiple times prior to filing to ensure you have accurately filled out the forms and maximized your deductions.\n",

       "This program is not overly appealing visually, but it's not terrible either. If you have the sound on, the voices (several are used depending upon where you are in the program) are a bit boring. Can anyone really fix that one though?  In parts of the program the makers use a space-age theme; in the Algebra Booster for example, there is a math game designed to help kids think algebraically while doing a Pac-Man type game. I played it and found it to be 'OK'.  My 11 year old wasn't overly impressed, but I think she was expecting it to play like her other video games. Bottom line: It really looks like something from 1999 versus 2009.\n",
       "\n",
       "CONTENT:  What's on the DVD?\n",
       "\n",
       "For each of the math subjects: Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I... through Calculus and Statistics, there are tabs at the top of the screen.\n",
       "\n",
       " \"Lessons\" has subcatagories of 'Basics' and 'Chapters'.  This is basically like a textbook or reference book that you can read when you need it.  Another tab, \"Challenge\" is a problem that in the end asks you questions, but I didn't find an answer to the question... just more questions.  I guess it's designed to help students think a bit deeper.  The third tab is \"Exercises\", which as you would imagine has questions relating to whatever subject inside a math type you are studying.  If you get the wrong answer, it tells you you're wrong, but since they are multiple choice, you never get an explanation, you just get to choose again.  You can view your score and get a report on which ones you got right and wrong to review.  \"Real Life\" is a story problem.  Using the current skill set to solve an every-day issue.  \"Animation\" is a short video illustrating the current skill. It's the company's attempt to 'cartoon up' the software. For visual learners this will be helpful, but the few I viewed were kind of stupid.\n",
       "\n",
       "The DVD also has bonus applications:  Runes of Avalon and Calculus Ipod material.  I couldn't get the link for the ipod material to open on my computer despite having iTunes and an Ipod Touch, but the game, Runes of Avalon, did install and I played it. It's more a spacial recognition game versus a math game, but it looks good (better than the rest of the software) and the gameplay was smooth.\n",

       "\n",
       "As for whether it was what I was looking for... yes and no. I expected explanations of the subjects listed. I got that and examples, just like a textbook would offer. What I didn't get was the ability to print off worksheets and answer sheets for practice. That would have been great! I found a few places online with free worksheets and some paid sites, but I had hopes that this would offer this and it didn't. Some more games would have been great too, as would the ability of the software to give feedback on a step-by-step basis, versus simply 'wrong' and then you figure it out.\n",

The current 2016 version offers online access to the living trust software for free for 1 year, but that implies a subscription thereafter, however the cost of that access is unclear.\n",
       "\n",
       "I purchased this, the newest version, more as a curiosity than a need. Having used both the 2011 and 2013 versions - neither is supported by Nolo anymore thus current legal changes (which may or may not be the case for your state) don't show up on the forms in the software. There's no way to tell if your state will have any changes to specific forms for years to come, thus using older versions of this software is probably OK - but there's no real way to know.\n",

       "If you are considering saving money by purchasing and older version of this software, just be aware your state may have some forms that have been updated and those updates won't be visible to you if updates are not supported.\n",
       "\n",
       "I currently use the 2013 version - updated from the 2011 version - and noticed no real difference in the two for my state. No updates to the forms took place in those two years. I could add both programs to multiple computers without an issue (Windows 7 and 8 PCs) and it could be used by multiple users. The information inputted into one program was imported by the updated version and thus I only had to put in the info one time.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing that will happen with older versions though is that when you go to do the 'Web Update' in the software, you will receive a message stating that that version is no longer supported by WillMaker.\n",
       "\n",
       "When I receive that message I click out of it and an update starts, but the update is only for the year of the software. For example in the 2013 version, the only updates the software received was for the year 2013. Legal changes to forms for other years did not show up.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frankly, it's just a ploy to keep you buying the updated software - and the combination of the update and an Amazon Lightning Deal got me again.

       "WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THIS SOFTWARE\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall this is a great DIY-kit for those who don't have the money to pay attorneys for these services, but truly it's much more than that because it includes so many useful forms and can be used by several people. The interview format makes filling out the forms easy to do, and there's room to customize if desired. The resulting documents are legally binding, but in most cases do need signatures with witnesses to make it so.\n",

       "If you have elderly parents, if you have children, if you have assets you want specifically dealt with in a certain way... this software is a cheap investment in protecting them all.\n",

It can also take videos and movies and optimize (compress) them for best performance on tablets and phones, upload them to social sites, and let you do light editing.  By light editing, I'm referring to taking clips and combining them.  For more comprehensive editing, you can use iMovie (free) or one of many commercial apps.  Toast also handles audio files.  It can read most file types and convert them if needed to other types.  It comes with a program that allows you to edit and clean up audio. While not as feature laden as some apps, it does most of the things you would need to do.\n",

The box I received had a slightly older version that has some issues with El Capitan.  Roxio allows you to download and install the app from their website. When you do that you get the latest version. It also makes installation on the newer MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs (no DVD drive) easy.\n",

       "So far the software has performed well.  I only have 2 complaints... sometimes certain features are hard to find.  I wanted to save a DVD to an ISO file.  By default, Toasts save an image to it's own filetype.  It took me a while to find out how to save it to an ISO file.  It's not as intuitive as Roxio's PC software (Creator).  This was the case with a couple of things I tried to do.  I also had a problem once installing it.  I installed it when I first got it and everything went fine.  About a month later, I changed the drive in my Mac and reinstalled everything.  The only software that didn't work was Toast.  It activated and appeared to work, but would hang when I actually tried to write a file or DVD.  I uninstalled it and did a reinstall and it's been working fine... probably just an anomaly.  Toast does not have an uninstall option or program. However they have good instructions on their website.\n",

You can plan your trips and side trips on a large screen, easily save and edit them, and look up possible destinations on the internet at the same time.  The bad news is you need your laptop in the car when you do go on a trip and that takes up a lot of room compared to the standalone GPS.

If you've never edited video, there is a learning curve.  On the Cyberlink site, you can download an ebook \"PowerDirector14 Tutorial\" that really helps learn this app.  That said, PowerDirector tries to make it easy.  However, you can tweak almost everything.  The defaults for outputting video are a good example... the quality settings all work well but you do have control over the settings.\n",

Lori Girard is a ditsy socialite who's desperate for attention, Charleena Purcell is a big time romance writer who we met in Secret of Shadow Ranch (She's a little annoying IMO), John Grey is the host of ghost chaser show, but his character doesn't really do anything, Tino Balducci is a hot-shot detective who got his big break when he just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and Frank and Joe Hardy are, as always, fun to talk to and very helpful. My favorite character in this game was Fatima from the gift shop - she was soo funny! \"It's FATIMA, with an F, none of that freaky PH stuff!\" Hahahahaah!\n",

       "SETTING - 5/5: The train was very beautiful. Very antique and a bit creepy at times, it fit the time period when it was built perfectly. All of the train cars were really well done. The gift shop and Copper Gorge was nice, too. The morgue was bit creepy - as it should be, but there wasn't much to explore there. And the desert at the end was very life-like.

Before she knows it, Beech Hill is robbed of one of its most beloved artifacts; a rare and unusual jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal. It seems to be related to a string of art thefts happening across the country, since in all the incidents Mayan jade artifacts were the target and a threatening red handprint was left at the scene.\n",
       "\n",
       "I thought this plot was just wonderful. It was well thought out, thorough, and unique among other ND titles. The length was perfect; I finished it over the course of a few days. There were lots of little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. It was interesting and intriguing, and very educational. Let me repeat that; it was VERY educational. It is set in a museum, after all. There is tons of information to take in - some of which is vital to the mystery of some of which is not. I have always loved history and am especially interested in the Maya and Aztec so this game was just my cup of tea. But if you don't like history - or aren't a big fan of plenty of reading in a ND game - this game might not be for you.\n",
       "\n",
       "CHARACTERS - 4/5: Suspects in this game include Joanna Riggs, the curator of Beech Hill and therefore Nancy's boss, a fairly serious young woman with a history of being a bit too eager to acquire artifacts for the museum. Henrik van der Hune is the museum's resident expert in translating Mayan glyphs, so he is arguably the only person in the museum who can guess an artifact's true value. Then there is Taylor Sinclair, an art dealer located in DC, who often does business with Joanna and appears to be unusually concerned over the museum's safety. Finally, there is Alejandro del Rio, a Mexican ambassador who accuses Beech Hill and other museums like it of flat-out stealing artifacts that rightfully belong to Mexico.\n",

       "Unfortunately, the four suspects weren't very memorable. Their personalities were not particularly well defined and there wasn't anything quirky or fun about them. Worst of all, none of them were very suspicious. Basically, no one from this cast of characters is going to be making my favorites list anytime soon. However, the previous deputy curator, Sonny Joon, seen only in notebooks he left behind at the museum, was absolutely hilarious and his notebooks were a delightful comic relief. I hear he shows up again in some of the newer titles so I'm really looking forward to that.\n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING - 5/5: The setting was excellent. Beech Hill was very interesting and there was tons to look at inside. If it were a real museum I would definitely visit. Other places to see include Nancy's hotel room, Taylor's office, Alejandro's office, as well as some other locations that are unlocked throughout the course of the game. One thing that really blew me away was how realistic it all was. There were little things - like how could you see the exterior of every building before you entered it - that made a huge difference. It was so easy to get into the mystery because it really felt like I was there.\n",
       "\n",
       "PUZZLES - 4.5/5: I liked the puzzles, though this game tended to repeat itself as far as puzzles go. In other words, you do the same thing a few times throughout the game. The puzzles in the museum were mostly information scavenger hunts, where Nancy would be posed with a quiz question and you would have to search the museum exhibits for the answer. That didn't bother me, but I could easily understand someone finding it tedious and too slow-paced. In hindsight this game wasn't as puzzle-heavy as some other ND titles, which worked for me as I'm not a huge puzzle fan. But the puzzles did work in seamlessly with the plot and I never felt like I was stuck doing something unnecessary just to make the game longer.\n",
       "\n",
       "IS IT CHALLENGING? Not really. Most - if not all - of the puzzles are explained by the game, and Nancy can call her friends for hints. I did go online for help once for a game of \"chance\" that I lost maybe 20 times in a row, thinking that there might be some strategy I was missing. But it seems that the mini-game couldn't be won until you reached a certain point in the plot, which frankly was pretty frustrating to learn I had wasted all that time. Anyways, I would give it a 3 for challenge.\n",

Although the ending was very intense, it was just sort of awkward and didn't make a whole lot of sense. The culprit wasn't too predictable and their motive made sense. Overall the ending was underwhelming. But be warned that the ending of this game is pretty creepy, and because of it I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for young children.\n",

The hotel's guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so I'm going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.\n",

It was really intriguing and had lots of twists and turns and really kept me on the edge of my seat.

       "CHARACTERS - 5/5: There was a good amount of characters in this game, and they all had incriminating evidence against them, so it was practically impossible to guess who the culprit was! There was Katie Firestone, a marine biologist who's nice, but virtually everyone in town hates her. Then there's Holt Scotto, and old school fisherman who's running for political office as Harbormaster. Jenna Dublin, who runs the local cafe and especially hates Katie. Then there's Andy Jason, who owns a whale museum and rivals Katie's whale watching tours.

       "PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.\n",
       "\n",
       "I thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said \"20+ hours of gameplay\", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered \"educational\". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like \"Oh great, here comes another history lesson.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.\n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.\n",
       "\n",
       "PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle \"in the corner\". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.\n",
       "\n",
       "IS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like \"Maybe you should take a look at the library again!\" it was more \"Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf.\" Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.\n",
       "\n",
       "ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.\n",

Depending on the brush you use you'll see a totally different result. You can use the soft cloner brush to brink back more detail from the underlying photo if you don't like what you see. This can all be automated via the auto-painting wizard but only let's you do it for a couple of brushes. If you want to use any other brushes like the particle brushes, as I show in my video, you need to do it manually and my video shows how.

Also, you can import brushes and work spaces with color palettes that other artists using the program use. But even essentials comes with over 100 brushes so it will keep you busy for quite a while if you end up enjoying it as much as I have.\n",

It also came with some sample images which you could play around with and I used one in my video. The new version comes with a 25 page manual which isn't very helpful at all and basically tells you to search YouTube which is the worst advice since there's hundreds of Painter video's which a person new to the program won't know where to start!\n",

       "If you are trying to scrimp on hardrive space or memory Win7 does use a bit less than Vista but still more than XP, since Movie maker, mail, and several other programs that always used to come with Windows have been removed and are now a optional download. That won't make the few people that use or depend on those programs happy but for the rest I'm sure they are happier for a slimmer Windows. The other changes people upgrading from Vista will notice is the annoying sidebar is gone and the taskbar is huge and works way different than Vista so it takes some learning to figure out where Microsoft moved everything to. It took me a while to figure out where all my stuff went since Win7 tries to be helpful and hide more stuff from you like Macos x. For example your taskbar notifications are still there but hidden by default. Nothing else really impressed me since almost all the stuff in Win7 was already there in Vista. Problem Step Recorder is a nice addition for those that help others troubleshoot their computers or is a quick and dirty way to make your own tutorials. And contrary to what others are seeing Win7 is not noticeably faster than Vista for most stuff except maybe networking and hibernation does seem to work better now. Then again since it never seemed to work before now that it does work is certainly an improvement. Windows 7 is also alot more helpful in trying to troubleshoot incompatible applications and games since a little wizard pops up trying to help you but if your program/game didn't work in Vista it most likely isn't going to work in Win7 either. Oh and another thing I turned off right away was Aero snap since it kept trying to be helpful by rearranging my windows for me which I hated. Alot of others seem to love this feature though. Other little things that Microsoft finally got around to adding to Windows is native burn support for ISO so you don't have to install Nero, usually one of the first pieces of software I install, and Blu-ray burn only support. This still doesn't make up for the lack of virtual desktops support, which Linux and Mac OS X have provided for the longest time and is one of the most useful features ever devised. This is one of the biggest oversight Microsoft continues to make which each new release. Maybe if they threw in native Blu-ray playback support for the Ultimate edition it would make sense to charge more.\n",
       "So that's my take from someone that used Vista since the day it was released and has been using Win7 since it was released roughly a month ago.\n",
       "Oh and finally I'm not too happy that even this latest more secure version of Windows can easily be rendered non-functional just by installing an old game. Any old game that using StarForce will install a driver that will immediately cause a blue screen of death upon reboot.

Microsoft should really put a hardblock on this since I was only able to recover my system due to my technical skills.

start wasn't good. I felt like giving it 0 stars for how must time I spent trying to activate it. It came with a very long code printed on the sleeve of the DVD it came with but every time I tried to enter it in the program it kept telling me the code was invalid! Only after searching Corel's support website did I find a document dedicated just to this since it must confound quite a number of their customers. The problem was they print their V's right up next to each other so what I kept typing in was a W instead of 2 V's!!! Only good thing about that is that I found out the DVD contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit version of the program. I'm glad I got it all straightened out because this really is a fun program to use.\n",
       "If you ever used Photoshop Elements or Lightroom a lot of things will look familiar and work similarly to those programs. For example, it opens up to a manage tab where you can see all your photographs as thumbnails and manage them by rating them or creating you own smart collections. It automatically creates collections from photos in your pictures folder based on date, tags, people, places and ratings. Then there is the adjust tab that lets you apply instant effects like artistic pencil, charcoal, black and white 10 different versions, retro several versions also, portrait that includes vignette, soft focus, infrared, smart photo fix, soft focus 1 and 2, skin smoothing, and various others. It'd be nice if it let you import your own custom effects from Painter but if you can I haven't figured it out. There is an option for user defined in the menu and an options button next to the effect but when you click on them they don't seem to do anything though. You also have your basic quick editing tools you'll find in any decent program like crop, straighten, red eye, clone brush, and makeover tool. The makeover tool is cool and something you usually won't find in Photoshop or other free programs since it includes several tools inside like thinify to make people skinny, suntan to darken people's skin, toothbrush to whiten teen, eye drop to whiten eyes and finally blemish fixer. They seemed to work pretty good and easier and faster than I have seen in other programs. The suntan tool for example you just brush over the person's face other parts of the skin and it automatically detects the edges so you don't have to be careful about darkening areas outside the face. Same with toothbrush, thinify, intuitive and very easy to use. Then underneath that is a button smart photo fix that will automatically try to correct brightness, shadows, highlights, saturation based on the histogram. If you don't like what it suggest you can manually correct using sliders that go from -100 to 100 or enter a number in a box. Then below that follow sections for white balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, vibrancy, local tone mapping, high pass sharpen, digital noise removal.\n",
       "Finally, if you can't find what your looking for in the second adjust tab there is the final full edit tab similar to develop in Lightroom or full edit mode in Photoshop Elements. This is where you have total control over layers, adjustment layers, mask layers, layer styles, basically most of what you would find in an expensive program like Photoshop. This is also where you'll find the most popular features promoted for this program which are Magic Fill and Magic Move. Magic Fill pretty much lets you remove unwanted elements in your pic. Just make a selection around it and the tool will do the work for you and remove it. Magic Move is even more impressive in that it will move something you select to anywhere else in your photo. In practice I found that it only really worked on simple scenes without a lot of complex detail. For example, move a bird person on a sand beach somewhere else and does great job since uniform background. Try to move person in busy street, signs or buildings in background and you end up with jumbled mess and will have to manually tweak the result!\n",
       "Even though it can be an overwhelming program with so many features for someone that's never used anything more complex than iPhoto, MS Paint, or Picasa it does come with a wizard of sorts like Photoshop Elements called Learning Center that walks you through the steps to accomplish a task. It can be found on the right side of the screen on the Edit tab and there are various sections like Get Photos, Quick Adjustments, Retouch and Restore, Layers and Selections, Text and Graphics, Effects, Advanced Adjustments, Print and Share. Some of them like Time Machine even pop up a second window that shows a preview of what the effect will look like with before and after photos which is really cool (See attached pictures). It even explains what the different types of photos are like Albumen, Cyanotype, Platinum and the time period they were used. After that some others that really impressed me and I had never seen before in a program are Perspective Correction, Single RAW Photo, HDR Merge (although I think Lightroom finally has it in latest version), and Depth of Field (I think new versions of Photoshop Elements also have DOF tool now but I have an older version so don't know). Depth of Field is really cool because you can quickly select an object and blur the background without having to use an expensive lens that provides great bokeh out of the camera or for something like an iPhone that isn't even capable of doing it. Basically, a lot of these neat features are things that could've been done straight out of the camera but weren't for some reason or the other and hence the need for programs like this. Finally, for power users you can script all you actions and then use them to batch process a bunch of photos at once!\n",
       "\n",
       "So in conclusion as you can see you definitely get a large amount of useful features for you money. I'll continue to use this program on my Windows machine since it has a lot of good stuff and some stuff Photoshop Elements, Picasa, Photoshop (the other Photo programs I use on my Windows machine. I use iPhoto, PE, and Photoshop on my Apple computer) are missing or is harder to accomplish certain tasks like skin smoothing which it does better job than other programs, HDR features, Depth of Field and perspective tools. Unfortunately this program isn't even an option for Mac users and so will have to stick with iPhoto/Llightroom since the new Photos program from Apple is so terrible.</td><td>09 26, 2015</td><td>A13EQE9EY2ET93</td><td>Daviangel</td><td>null</td><td>You definitely get a large amount of fun and useful features for you money</td><td>1443225600</td><td>false</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>B00AM9YXTS</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>Or like me they will find themselves tolerating over time by ignoring it's most obnoxious features.\n",

       "I've been running Windows 8 upgrade for the last couple of days and wanted to give my initial impressions of the latest Microsoft OS, as someone that's been using Windows forever i.e. Win 3.11;it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be and then again not as good as it could be.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I ran the compatibility checker of course and it said all hardware was compatible and only had a couple of software problems like it said I had to uninstall security essentials and wireshark not compatible. Not bad I thought. First impressions are important and the Windows 8 upgrade setup program didn't give a good first impression. It's more confusing that the older Win7 installer for experienced user. I couldn't tell if I could install on separate partition since the only options were erase everything or upgrade everything. And a WARNING if you plan on keeping Windows 7 around in case you are not sure if you want to stick with Windows 8 don't run the installer inside Windows because it will automatically upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 8! Later I figured out you can get the more familiar win 7 installer,if you boot directly from the DVD that is, where it lets you choose what partition to install on and let's you erase, create new partitions and do a clean install. Anyways, I did a dual boot install just to play it safe and keep Win7 around if needed. After finishing the install ,which didn't really seem much faster than Win7, and actually I thought it locked up at one point but it was hard to tell with the new plain square logo which doesn't even pulsate anymore like Win7 did when you booted.\n",

       "After the upgrade completed, I found out that my wireless didn't work. That's right even though it said my wireless was compatible it didn't work and I just got yellow exclamation next to it. I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.\n",
       "\n",
       "The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. You know the GUI is unintuitive when they have to show a video just so you can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. I think the two things that are going to annoy most people is the lack of the Start button and inability to boot directly to the old classic desktop instead of Metro. I know it still bugs me!\n",
       "\n",
       "All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Gotten a lot fewer crashes than when Win7 first came out. My problematic wireless usb, which I mentioned isn't compatible, even though Windows 8 says it is has been causing the most problems even causing a BSOD!\n",
       "\n",
       "Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.\n",
       "\n",
       "I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.\n",
       "\n",
       "Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something I downloaded from the Internet, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. It get's very annoying if you don't have an Internet connection because it will appear that the installation program is frozen until it figures out you aren't connected! So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another one that is causing uproar in the Linux community since it causes headaches if you want to dual boot Windows and Linux.\n",
       "\n",
       "Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.\n",
       "\n",
       "As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, you need to get the media center upgrade, to play DVD's, otherwise you can't even play dvd's without installing powerdvd or some other program!

I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.\n",

       "  The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. I thought this is pretty bad that they have to show a video just so people can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. Only thing that still annoys me and don't know if there is way to fix it is how slow the start icon and everything else takes to come up when you move your mouse to a corner of the screen. I know it's only a fraction of a second but it's still noticeable and that's why I just use the Windows key now to switch between things! Also, the hotspots in the corners tend to get in the way more often than not.\n",

       "  All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Haven't had a crash or even a pause in the GUI like I used to get with those when they first came out so that's a good sign.\n",
       "\n",
       " Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.\n",
       "\n",
       "  I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another but I haven't messed with that.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.\n",

       "  As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.\n",

The simple reason is they often cause problems, particularly performance related problems, and as a result wind up being disabled altogether. The fact is it is very difficult to make a comprehensive security suite that functions on as many as 21 different versions of XP, Vista, and Windows 7, with differing levels of service packs, and any number of potentially conflicting installed software that comes with or is preinstalled by browsers, ISPs, OEMs, etc. By using a standalone product you can exercise total control over what's being controlled and easily identify any problems or conflicts. Moreover, I question the utility of some of the extraneous features of the whole security suites like identity protection. Or to put it another way, if you're going to buy one security product, make it an anti-virus product.

It is not that I wasn't able to use it effectively, and it did work, it is just that Corel needs to make that one feature Word Perfect. Hey I have to write an honest review. They also provide a standalone spell checker tool for doing just that. The Grammatik may be checking further terms and grammar usage further down the line, and then coming back to prior word usage, and that is why I am getting the doubling of some word checks.

Most of what I was interested in was only an explanation of it, and then an invitation to purchase what I needed. So it was a sales tool in order to buy more things. Suddenly the whole thing wasn't so beneficial after all. Of course I would be over-stating my claim if I said that there wasn't anything beneficial in there, but those two features alone when it is subtitled as contracts and forms was a bit of a disappointment to say the least.\n",

It is fascinating to see his depth of knowledge transform itself on the screen. He has been using an older version of the top Chief Architect program, version 9.5 with a hefty price tag. With this newer version, albeit a junior version of their flagship product, shows many advances over the old full version of the program. He didn't need to draw up blueprints because when it got to the point that additions were being built, he would hire a licensed architect to take his plans and finalize them for approval.\n",

In addition this designer 10 does not have the same sophisticated CAD program.

       "You have a choice of jumping off of the diving board by loading the new version of QB 2013 by overwriting the old version, and then converting your existing company files but unconverting them, and restoring them is a major hassle. So the following is important to know.\n",
       "\n",
       "You can run both versions of QuickBooks (in my case 2010 and 2013) concurrently/at the same time. So you are keeping your old version of QuickBooks intact while you try out the new one. (They currently have a 60 day return policy so take it for a test drive) This is important. When installing it asks you, \"Do you want to overwrite your old version?\" If you want to test it out and not go through the rigamarole of reconverting, or restoring your old version in case you want to send the new version back, say NO by choosing the option above it in order to write it to a new location. They already have a folder designated to do that when you choose that option and it is called \"QuickBooks 2013\". Don't worry about choosing your industry edition; you can always change it later from within QuickBooks. Note: If you install it on more than one computer you must install the same industry edition. This way you can try QuickBooks without over writing your existing version, OR converting your current company files over to the 2013 version either. So play with the sample file, or do as I did if you are creating a new company in addition to the old one. So with both version running and open, if I have an order from a customer from one company I can process it without having to open and close companies to access it. In plain words I have one click access to both companies. So both Qbooks versions are open, and both companies are open at the same time. That is something you cannot do if you only have one version of QuickBooks. You can however have two companies open if you install QB into a laptop also. (They allow you one other install but only if you use the same industry edition. So for example if you have a manufacturing company and a retail business they have different industry editions)\n",
       "\n",
       "So now onto the three pound monster; the color schemes. In 2012 you had the option of choosing an assortment of color schemes. You don't have that option in 2013. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that they chose colors that create headaches; well at least in some people.  I love the way 2010 looks. It is reminiscent of Outlook 2007 with its soft blues and grays. It is pleasant to look at and easy to read. 2013 has the same icons and choices (how are they going to improve on something in any major way that has been through a zillion years of tweaking to make it Intuit-ive?) BUT they changed it slightly with the biggest problem as I see it (no pun intended) is they included black backgrounds with reversed out white letters. Our eyes get adjusted to that, and then on the same page they have these super soft letters on a bright background which is a seismic shift. I can see what they mean that this could give you a headache after awhile. So I thought I would convert it some by minimizing the left side navigation pane, which is easy to do with one click of the mouse, but the problem is that when you use any one of the features such as invoicing, credit memos, estimates etc up comes those screens with the same black header reversed out and you can't change that.  On a cerebral-vision basis it is not conducive to reducing the workload, but rather increasing it. Your eyes and vision set have to constantly readjust depending on which part of the page you are focusing on.  As soon as you open the program and spend a few minutes with it, you immediate feeling will be how do I change the black headers only to find out you can't. The headers also give you a feeling of the old DOS days; it is real basic and the level of graphics is Neanderthal. The rest of the work area is fine. I don't have any problem with soft lettering, or the nicely colored icons; just change the headers, and/or include some color scheme changes.\n",
       "What else is there?\n",
       "\n",
       "I have been using Intuit products since the DOS days in the 80's. Easy to use, intuitive, and great for small businesses. There is no way they are not going to fix this. There are too many people complaining about it. It will have a devastating effect on sales. Intuit is the best and I am sure they will be updating by re-creating the color scheme choice like they had in 2012, or at the very least go back to the pleasant default color scheme in some earlier versions. If they don't hold onto your 2012 version because they are going to become more and more valuable especially if Intuit stops making the 2012 version.\n",
       "\n",
       "UPDATE: Okay I am going to have to tip my hat because Intuit did \"correct\" the problem. Why do I put quotes around correct? I don't want to nit pick but I have to be critical. What they did with R6 free update (R9 is out now) is \"Company File Color Scheme\" option is introduced in the \"Desktop View\" preference to allow users to change the color of the title bar and the border of QuickBooks windows for a particular company file, which will help users to differentiate between multiple company files. This preference will be replacing the \"Company Color Flag\" preference introduced in R4 release. We are offering 14 different \"Company File Color Scheme\" options to apply on various company files. This is a user level preference, which essentially means that various users connected to the same company file can select different colors. (R6)\n",
       "\n",
       "That was a copy and paste from Intuit of the improvement. What it means is that the title bars have been made adjustable into some really nice colors. My main concern was how the large black background area with white text was creating an eye set, if I can use that expression which was pretty bold, and then you had to re-adjust your eyes in order to see the fine print in lighted out gray in the forms etc. So it was a headache waiting to happen. At first I dismissed others comments but then saw exactly what they were saying, and had to agree with them. So what did Intuit do? They did not get rid of the large black background to the main menu on the left, BUT you can minimize that so it is a small border on the left side of the screen. Then they gave you this option to change the title bar color options with some beautiful colors, while at the same time changing the title bar titles themselves into all caps to help balance the visibility out. All in all it is very useable now.\n",
       "\n",
       "In all fairness in my 2010 version the invoices for example have black backgrounds with white letters in the inner title bars but the black bars are a lot thinner. 2013 has large black bars still. BUT with the other changes it is very manageable, and I would now have to say that I give the whole program a triple thumbs up and 5 stars. I also must admit that the left main menu is easier to read with a black background and white letters, rather than a lesser contrast option so they did good. The fact that you can minimize that whole window, and then you are working almost exclusively in your color choice (and the ones they give you are beautiful) makes this a top drawer program.

(I am an old late 80s DOS guy to start) They have always been way ahead of the curve in making easy to use intuitive products; hence the name Intuit.

       "One important tip is that if you are running more than one business you may want to keep your old version as well. Be sure and back up your company files before loading a new version. When loading any new version of QuickBooks it asks you if you would like to keep the old version, or overwrite it. I keep the old version AND I choose not to have my company file updated to the new version. That way I can keep two versions of QuickBooks open at the same time. It is tedious to have to close one company, and open another every time a customer has a question. So by having two versions running concurrently, you can click on either tab and have instant access. You also can have one version running on one machine, and another version running on another if you have more than one person in the office, and each one assigned to a different company. It saves money that way not having to pay for two new versions when the old one works fine.</td><td>12 15, 2013</td><td>A14JBDSWKPKTZA</td><td>Bob Feeser</td><td>List(null,  Software, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>I'm an Intuit fan.

I took a manual drafting course in high school which is the way, as I understand it that most architectural schools start out their students in the first year; with pencil drafting. As one architect put it, \"It forces you to get comfortable thinking and expressing yourself in a precise way with the pencil. Good designers continue to draw throughout their lives, but everyone uses CAD for production work.\" I also had a woodworking business that I used to design and build such projects as wainscoting, steps, doors, etc. I did a lot of conceptual drawings by hand which helped me to think through the type of joinery and how everything would come together. I spent a couple of hundred dollars on drafting supplies including a good board. Then I used a basic drawing program such as the one in MSWorks to get it down comfortably and be able to make up a materials list, and cutout guide. Once all of that work was done, everything in the shop was just a paint by numbers game. I wanted to graduate to a more sophisticated drawing program so I downloaded the free Google Sketchup program. I knew my work in MS Works draw program was not to scale, and the beauty is in the proportions. I made up for that by going into the shop and creating a mock up of rough lumber to get the feel for what the end result would look like and in what proportions.\n",

       "Sketchup is not considered the exacting tool that AutoCAD is. Although Google Sketchup is not considered very good for accurate drafting, many architectural firms do their initial sketching in Google Sketchup and then move onto further drafts and detail drawings in AutoCAD. Many even claim that they use Sketchup to do their rough drawings instead of pencil. Sketchup is considered to be simple, powerful, and intuitive which is evidenced by so many who continue to use Sketchup in conjunction, pairing it up with a good CAD program such as AutoCAD.\n",

       "The largest difference I see between AutoCAD the full program, and the LT version is 3D modeling in the full version. That 3rd dimension adds a lot of appeal. Some say that once you get used to working in 3D you will never want to go back to 2D again. There are a lot of other enhancements in the full version, but they are better reviewed by someone who is using both versions on a regular basis. In addition side by side comparison charts are available on the web. AutoCAD LT came about by request as I understand it from so many in the user community requesting something less expensive that would handle their needs for 2D instead of having to purchase a big, full featured customizable 3D capable program. So AutoCAD LT was born.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a professional the time savings is one big advantage over hand drafting because if you had to make a project wide change on a blue print you can just quickly make the changes and then print out a new draft, instead of having to cleanly erase, or worse yet, recreate a whole new version.\n",

It had problems every step of the way. So I decided to uninstall it and try shutting off my McAfee antivirus, as well as my Scotty the Watchdog Win Patrol that alerts me, with options every time someone tries to install a program on my machine at boot up, eating up valuable resources.

Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components.

As the description states, World's Fastest Rendering -TrueVelocity 5 leverages hardware and software technologies to speed up video processing and outperform all others. TrueVelocity is optimized for modern CPU and GPGPU hardware platforms from Intel, AMD and NVIDIA to maximize memory allocation and usage. So it is compatible with all three manufacturers Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA of display adapters.\n",
       "My Adobe Premiere Elements 12 is not compatible with Windows 10, at least not in every function, but fortunately Corel Video Studio Pro X8 has released a free update to 8.5 which is.

       "When I first got Corel X8 I was pleased that it had an easy-peasy video editor option that made it a candy walk to create a video right out of the box. This Cyberlink Director 14 has an equivalent easy editor. That probably has a lot to do with the instant results, and wall to wall 5 star reviews of those stating how easy it is to use out of the box. Others who delve into the more complex functions of video editing, and are frustrated that they cannot master it right away are those who are slamming the software with low star ratings. If you want a fully featured program that does incredible things, and enables you to do things that you simply cant do with for example Windows Movie Maker then there is going to be a learning curve.\n",

       "The thing I love the most about CPD 14 is that you can edit this with 4 different camera angles. I have multiple high def. cameras, some more expensive than others, and I know how great it is to have different angles to capture the excitement of a scene. When a scene is captured using just one angle it creates boredom for the viewing audience. Having a multiple method option for synchronizing all 4 whether it be automatically through the audio track, or by markers that you can set and tweak using right and left arrows controlling individual frames etc. is an option that is worth the price of admission.\n",

       "Much is said about the lack of an owners manual and not without merit. But with the price of the manual to print, and then the large increase in shipping such a product compared to a simple disc in a light box it makes the lack thereof a smart move. Having a digital manual is just as convenient except for those who stubbornly hold onto having to have a book on the desk. To be honest I wish all of my books were scanned so my entire library would take up zero shelf space in the FireHDX. With the split screen in Windows 8 + you can divide a good sized monitor into the right half, and left half, and operate both programs at once without even having to bring them back up; they just stay there.

       "First of all forgive me for writing such a long review, but there is a lot of ground to cover. For those who like the short version, with less information here it is: Norton slowed my DSL connection down by a third. I spent a day with Verizon, couldn't figure out why all of my other machines in the network were getting 756k, and this one got only 4 or 500 tops. Then I removed Norton, and bingo, instant 756k. AVG free edition is nice but takes a lot of boot up time while it updates upon every single boot up, unless you disable that feature, then it sends out your Outlook email with a message that your antivirus is out of date, and this email could be dangerous, or something like that. Zone Alarm used to be the best, now they are nearing the worst. My Windows 2000 machine went blue screen after an update, took me 2 days to figure out that was the problem, so I removed it after discovering the problem in a forum, and it solved it. Also ZA after recommending it to my friend, would not work at all in a Windows XP Media Center machine. Ask ZA and they say they no longer support it in Media Center. 50 bucks down the drain. Now it takes my XP regular edition SP2 well over 5 minutes to boot with Zone Alarm Security Suite, and I mean WELL over 5 minutes; it's ridiculous. I removed it to load this McAfee Virus Scan (MVS), and the machine immediately booted in only 2 minutes and 15 seconds to the point I was able to bring a Google page up. So I loaded this MVS and the machine booted in only 2 minutes and 45 seconds, once again to a Google page appearing. In both cases I clicked on a Google desktop icon as soon as it appeared, and then waited for the results. It clicks, goes dark blue, and waits for everything else to load, including MVS before it will allow a page to appear. So MVS took only 30 additional seconds to load, and according to Scotty the watchdog in WinPatrol, it loads about 7 .exe files. So that is fast. Now that is with a machine that is loaded up with a ton of programs.\n",
       "\n",
       "I first loaded MVS in my home office machine, in the same network, with the same configuration, Asus A8N SLI, AMD 64 3200+, 1Gb ram. The home office machine with MVS loaded, gave me the same results but in approximately one minute before I could get a Google page up. (This is an edit, I actually timed the boot up, and not counting the time to type in my password, it booted in exactly 42 seconds) Boot up to Google in only a minute with MVS, and in 2 minutes and 45 seconds in my overloaded machine that used to take well over 5 minutes with Zone Alarm. I'm sold.\n",
       "\n",
       "While performing a scan it did not affect the performance of the machine, either in surfing the web, or opening programs, even the intensive programs like Dreamweaver MX 2004, or Photoshop CS2.\n",
       "\n",
       "When loading do as the quick start guide says, put in the CD, then choose the option of loading from the web. It's a 45 Meg download, but it's the latest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Manage network feature, it recognized all of the other machines, and components with an IP address in my network. It recognized my Windows Server 2003 R2 Edition, but gave me a status message of a request to upgrade to an operating system of at least W2000 or later. I guess that is because of W2003 security, blocking scans.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before I even acquired MVS I did not understand exactly what they meant by the 3 user allowance, and couldn't find anything on it, so I want to share that with you. Did they mean that you could load it on one machine sharing a network, and then scan individual drives across the network, the same way early ZA did, or does this mean you can put it in more than one machine for full protection at all times. Fortunately it means the latter. I loaded it in the home office machine, registering it in my name to be able to get virus updates, and created a user name and password. Then I went into the other machine, dropped in the CD, did a complete install, but when the registration page came up, I logged in instead, and it instantly completed the registration for me, reminding me of my user name and password, and congratulating me on the installation. So it is a 3 machine complete install, that is cool, or should I say way cool.\n",
       "\n",
       "I know this isn't about MVS but I advise you to get a free copy of CCleaner from the web. (Google it.) It cleans all the junk out of your computer and you can run it quickly before entering sensitive password sites for example. It cleans out your cache, cookies, etc. in only a few seconds. When you run it for the first time, it will take several minutes to remove it all, for example a ton of web pages you have been surfing, that your machine checks first, before drawing it from the distant server. A slooooow way for your machine to have to work.\n",

       "McAfee has been around for a zillion years, they have been a leader, and from the performance of this product so far, they have totally aced it. You can see all of the other antivirus and firewall programs I have tried, and this one according to boot up time, and scan speed is the best. It scanned my office machine quickly, although I did not time it accurately. It scanned several gigs of data in what seemed like 10 minutes. My other machine with 230 Gigs of data takes about 5 hours with Zone Alarm, because I am using their older 7.0 version, it took 3 times that long with their newer version that works with Vista and XP. I am using it on an XP machine. Once again, had to get rid of the update, and go back to an earlier version.\n",
       "\n",
       "Look I can't speak for everyone, or everyone's machine, but all I know is I am totally impressed with this McAfee product, and hope and pray they don't go down the tubes like Norton, and Zone Alarm did. (I have not used any recent Norton products, but Norton was the best when Peter Norton was there solving the DOS problems, almost like a miracle man, then from about 10 years ago, everything of theirs I tried was junk.) Sorry for the pointed remarks, but sometimes you find a product, after spending years in frustration, or at least you find something that works, then it goes bad, and finally, finally, something that really works great like this MVS. For me, my hat is off to McAfee. 150 Stars and counting. Highly recommended to say the least.\n",

It was frustrating, but I have loved Coreldraw, and the other suite of programs in the graphics suite, and will now be able to enjoy them.\n",
       "For what it is worth, below is my original review and some of the frustration I experienced. It is entirely possible that Corel was having a problem with their servers on this day, making functionality difficult to say the least. I really do love the program. Below is my original review.\n",
       "\n",
       "The thing I love about Corel Draw is the ease of use. I have several expensive Adobe products and the learning curve is radical. Corel has built in several different levels of sophistication. They have simplified ways of doing everything so anyone can get professional results. As far as another comment that they have zero support that is inaccurate. You can Google Corel support and they have a huge contact us page with three options: 1) Chat Online 2) Submit a ticket to support and get an answer within 24 hours 3) Call them with the listed 800 number Mon-Thurs 9am -10pm, and Friday 9am  7pm EST.  I used the chat feature and was instantly connected to a representative at get a load of this 7:01 am on a Tuesday EST. When you get into a chat they answer all of your questions, and they automatically send you an email notifying you that a support ticket with number has been created for you so you can use that feature as well, and they have a copy of your chat session to bring them up to date. Now that is what you call first class support.\n",
       "So what I learned from my chat session is that you can install this software into up to 3 machines (that you own) and only use it in one machine at a time. The software is licensed per household or per single address. According to their EULA (End User License Agreement) you are leasing the software not buying it. As they say in the EULA The below agreement gives you permission to install and Use one copy of this product on one computer or electronic device at any given time as set out in the details in the EULA. That is what it says but the chat person said you can install it in up to 3 but only one usage at any given time. Also on the X7 sale page here at Amazon the Corel factory representative responded to the Q&A the same way with install of up to 3 machines with one use at a time.\n",
       "Also the EULA says this is a license, not a sale. The software is licensed to you, not sold to you. You may not sell, rent, lease, resell, or loan the software. That is a bit of a disappointment to me because I purchased X7 and was hoping to be able to sell it. Not! It aint going to happen. However my brother lives with me and Corel said him using it is no problem. Same household, and not more than one person using it at the same time. Corel X8 installs right on top of X7 and you can have both of them installed at the same time. So if you are unsure about compatibility it is advisable to install X8 first before, if you decide to uninstall X7. That way you won't go through any hassles reloading X7 for any reason. I cant see why you would need both; X8 does it all and then some.\n",
       "This is a bit disheartening. When you open any part of the software it is precluded with a sing in box and when trying to sign in I get an unexpected server error. Then I try the second email address I have registered with Corel it says incorrect user name or password. So after many frustrating attempts to be able to use the software I unchecked the box that said I already have an account. Then clicked on continue and it says this email address is already in use. So I did a chat after logging into my account using the same email address and password that was refused as a server error when trying to use the program and they wanted me to do a screen capture of the error message. Then the screen capture function in my successful install of X7 before didn't work right. So the support person said I had to reinstall the program. So I thought first I would reboot after the X8 install and I did. Up came the same error message not letting me get into the program. So I took the chat reps advice and tried to uninstall so I could reinstall. He told me to use Control Panel to uninstall. When I went into Control Panel and selected the program the message came up to wait while the program finishes the install first.  Something was going on because my entire machine was running at a snails crawl. So I waited, and after a while the control panel screen came up and gave me options so I tried using the repair feature instead of removal and see how that goes. That is running now. It is taking forever. Its been several minutes and it is 6% complete. I will spend hours getting this sorted out. X7 loaded without a catch before. For now I have to give this experience 2 stars. Hopefully when it is all said and done I can move the ratings up.\n",
       "I must say that even though the support chat told me that I can install X8 right alongside X7 I am suspect that it could be the cause of the problem. Only time will tell. Both programs show up as separate apps in Win 10. I can load X7 programs fine. But then again if I uninstall X7 and X8 turns out to be the problem, then I will have to find the X7 disc which is buried in a box somewhere because I have been remodeling my house. Will come back after I get this sorted out.

It is a good solid product. Back in the DOS days Norton Utilities was a godsend, correcting errors before they turned into total system crashes. Then the company was sold and everything they put out was terrible; it caused more problems than it solved. Well all of that has changed. June 2010 issue of Consumer Reports rates Norton Internet Security 2010 as their top rated pick stating, \"It is one of the best products tested for detecting web sites that host malware, and for speed in scanning a hard drive for threats\". I think that about says it all. It's the most effective, and the fastest. What else is there?\n",
       "\n",
       "I ran speed tests back then when removing McAfee and installing Norton in order to see which one had the longer boot time and once again Norton came out on top. I have not had any problems whatsoever running Norton Internet Security 2010, 2011, Norton 360 for 2012-13, and now Norton 360 2014. The price has come down some since I acquired it. It is good for up to 5 independent devices whether they be laptops, desktops, and now even covers your cell phone. I have a Windows Cell Phone and as is the case for that relative newbie not many programs are written for it including this version of Norton 360. I have seen others reporting that it slows their boot time on their cell phone.\n",

       "If you are removing McAfee from your machine and you should before installing Norton be sure to not only use the Control panel add remove programs utility but also to Google how to remove it from the web because they have a downloadable utility in order to completely remove it from your system. You never want to install two different antivirus programs on top of one another. However just like when I installed 360 right on top of my 2011 version of Norton and as I suspected it automatically recognized it and did all of the chores for me including removing the old version before installing the new. I also noticed that most of my machines that I installed it in after putting in the activation code/product key it came back as being successfully installed and activated. Only on my main machine that probably received the initial install of Norton back in 2010 when I first started using it did it actually call up the online activation without automatic approval; it required that I log into my Norton account with user name and password in order to activate, but that was the only one.

You also have the option of configuring your Anti-Virus program, unfortunately I have not been able to do so because my Anti-virus is not supported, although it seems (Norton Anti-virus Corporate Edition 7.6).

Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is \"awesome\", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs.

When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, \"ME\" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers.

It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro.

I really recommend you purchase money if you don't have it. I implore users. If you are a Quicken user, stick with it, I think Quicken is more powerful than Money regardless of the many bells and whistles it has.

But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.\n",

But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.\n",

       "So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).\n",
       "\n",
       "And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers.

And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet.

AV suites are about as much protection as possible, but when my performance is cut almost in half, I had to look for an alternative.  Though I have used many different anti-virus and internet security suites over the years (Kaspersky, Trend Micro, AVG, etc.), for the purposes of this review, I am comparing only McAfee and Norton as I installed McAfee over the Norton installations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Comparing the two, they have both worked well for me.  The main difference between McAfee and Norton is that McAfee is much more hands off.  Use the installer and the most current package is downloaded and then installed.  Once installed, it does its thing with very little setup or configuration.  Conversely, Norton came with a full version on the cd and after the install it asks to download the latest definitions and updates.  This route of install definitely took longer; and with the prevalence of high speed internet access that isn't that big of a deal --- of course it would be a big deal if you are still on dial up.  Norton also has a lengthy configuration process and while it \"learns\" your habits, pop ups and config questions constantly come on asking you to proceed, block, allow, accept, etc.  Not a big deal if you are fairly comfortable with computers, but people like my dad that only has basic skills were always afraid of doing the wrong thing so the first month I would always get a call asking me what to do.\n",

You can repeat a single, simple syllable over and over and watch the analysis be completely different every time.  The important part to notice is that it does not register a \"fail\" (as in, \"you said it wrong\"); it simply does not take input from the microphone.  It registers an \"I did not hear you\" sound, and no amount of begging will convince it you are speaking.  At other times, I have discovered that the only way to get something \"right\" is to intentionally pronounce something wrongly--for example, anything like \"Ich\", \"Spreche\", etc. with a \"ch\" has a far better chance of success if pronounced as an English \"sh\" (as in \"she\", \"shy\") rather than the correct sound.\n",

To illustrate that I am not completely incapable of repeating a very basic sound, I recorded the voice of the Rosetta Stone native speaker and played it back to the program.  It was wrong over 80% of the time.  When I pointed this out, the support organization then suggested that it was perhaps a problem with the microphone, and transferred me to a different department to give me the privilege of buying another microphone from them (gee, thanks... $600 for this software and you want me to buy another microphone because by your own admission the microphone you included is broken?  that seems ummm... really...  reasonable).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Rather than purchase the oh-so-cheap microphone, I elected to purchase a very nice microphone from SoundBlaster.  This product works great--for every piece of software except Rosetta Stone, which continues to be unable to understand even the most basic phrases.  I then tried a rather nice Logitech--same results--great precision everywhere else and nothing in Rosetta Stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The most frustrating part of this is that some days, Rosetta Stone will work just fine.  I can go through lesson after lesson with perfect scores; then suddenly it simply decides to fail.  Occasionally a reboot will help, but generally just for a few minutes, then it is back to being horrible.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, it is a shame that a piece of software that is otherwise quite a good way to introduce you to a new language is (a) so insanely bad in a critical product area, and (b) the company refuses to recognize the deficiency.  This software is never going to make anyone a fluent speaker--even with these problems fixed--but if I knew I were being dropped into German in three months, it would certainly be something I believe would prepare me to get by and build the base I needed for eventual fluency after living there for a few years.\n",

       "Rosetta Stone Version 3 is an excellent way to introduce someone to a new language.\n",
       "\n",
       "SETUP\n",
       "Reasonably easy, but I would strongly recommend an Internet connection during installation to get all the features unlocked.  I did the installation on an airplane, and found out that I was missing a few things.  This is easily remedied later.\n",
       "\n",
       "COURSE CONTENT\n",
       "Overall, the course content is very good, using only the German language--there is no use of English at all, except for menu options and such.  This is not, therefore, a course that relies at all on \"translation\".  Rather, the course uses images and audio to acquaint the user with key words and phrases, then re-enforces them by using them in different orders, combining them in different ways, etc. until the use becomes natural.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is generally quite effective, but in some areas falls short.  For example, the intricacies of German articles (is it \"Der\", \"Das\", \"Die\"?) can be a little tricky to pick up in this way--it would be nice to have at least some explanation of how these are used in a general sense, explaing how they are used with respect to gender and plurality.\n",
       "\n",
       "An unfortunate feature is that the images appear to be very generic, as opposed to specifically related to the German culture.  I assume that this allows Rosetta to recycle these images for other languages, but it diminishes the quality of the immersion program, and is my reason for giving this product only four stars.  To truly learn a language, one must understand its culture as well, and having images that match that culture would greatly enhance the experience.\n",

So every three years or so, I find myself forced to cough up $50 for a piece of software that does substantially the same thing as the previous versions (including all the same bugs).  Quicken 2011 is no different.  Here are the major drawbacks:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. We continue to be unable to import any file from anyone who has not paid Intuit for the privilege.  Some smaller banks and many 529/401(k) programs do not want to spend their money on this so there is no way to download transactions from those companies directly into the software.  There is not even a simple import format that they could provide for manual import--that has been completed eliminated from the Quicken product.  They should at least provide that so someone could build a spreadsheet for import.  Contrary to Intuit's position, it is not rocket science to build a file with \"Txn Date\", \"Txn Description\", and \"Amount\" line items.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The UI unnecessarily provides all its own elements.  That is, it does not use the standard text boxes, toolbars, and so forth built into Windows that you see in a browser form and most other applications.  The result of this is a very slow refresh time every time you switch pages within the product or switch to Quicken from another application, noticeable even on a fast, modern machine.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. About every six months, an account randomly gets itself out of balance.  TIP:  It is often the very first transaction for the account that has been corrupted--perhaps you started with an opening balance of zero four years ago, and all of a sudden the opening balance is $76.23 or something, so everything is off by that amount.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Ads abound.  They are littered across your desktop, your start menu, your program menu, your taskbar, the UI itself.  You cannot even start the application without being asked if you want a Quicken credit card before you can use the program.  I paid for this software--I should not see ANY ads.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. You are not buying this software, you are renting it.  It will cease working with full functionality in 2014 (or earlier if Intuit's CEO has a bad day at the races).\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Getting support is very spotty.  Support from Intuit itself generally consists of, \"let's try to uninstall and re-install your software and keep our fingers crossed.  If you have to re-enter 15 years of transactions across 25 accounts afterwards, well, that's too bad\".  You can get support from the Quicken forums, but unfortunately it consists primarily of \"yeah, that happened to me, too--let me know if you solve it\" and bombastic fanboys telling everyone else that it couldn't possibly be Intuit's software causing the problem; it is obviously your fault.\n",

I speculate that some of the other elements of the program, such as the anti-phishing and anti-spyware, may be using other processes in memory and slowing down performance only for applications that trigger them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ironically, it seems like those components do not work as well as the included alternatives in competing programs.  Testing these out in a lab environment, the McAfee program was one of the slowest to detect spyware and phishing risks for known vulnerabilities.  There are some additional features that can compensate for that on the enterprise version of the product, but on this one you just have to accept that it is slightly slower at detecting those things.\n",
       "\n",
       "The \"Total Protection\" version of the product also includes a network aware component that may appeal to SMB customers.  That program is supposed to detect rogue network devices and similar risks, but I have seen poor to mixed results with it.  I suspect there is overhead in this program for those features included in Total Protection version of the product that haven't been activated here.  I can't be 100% sure, but considering how much faster the anti-virus engine runs it is one possible reason why there is still a slowdown of system performance for certain situations.\n",
       "\n",
       "One other thing that I noticed was that the newest version of Norton Internet Security has a much more detailed application firewall.  For those that use many complex internet applications that require custom settings, that program offers more granular control for those willing to dig down into the settings.  The basics are all covered here, but it is not as easily reconfigured.  On the same token, the default setting of the program requires constant confirmation for the system to adjust security settings for your applications.  It is possible to limit these warnings, but the configuration is not set ideally out of the box.\n",
       "\n",
       "CONCLUSION\n",
       "\n",
       "The strengths of the program are the improved easy to use interface and faster anti-virus scanning.  This 2009 version will definitely use less system memory than prior versions, at least directly.  It seems easy to punish McAfee and Norton for their past sins, but both products have improved slightly in that regard.  But you still have to decide if you really need some of the cleaner interface and faster scanning of these products, since there are free products that will do the same job and save you the annual subscription cost.  Also make sure that you know what features are most important to you.  If you need more control of your application firewall settings, you may want to explore the alternatives.\n",
       "\n",

I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient.

The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.

There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.\n",

I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).</td><td>AHNHLGKIZ2N3B</td><td>D.

       "\n",
       " Likes:\n",
       "\n",
       "+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n",
       "+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n",
       "+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\n",
       "+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n",
       "+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n",

       " Rants & Irritants:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n",
       "\n",
       " Installation:\n",
       "\n",
       "The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n",
       "\n",
       "What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n",
       "\n",
       " SkyDrive:\n",
       "\n",
       "I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n",
       "\n",
       " Word:\n",
       "\n",
       "The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n",
       "\n",
       "Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n",
       "\n",
       " Excel:\n",
       "\n",
       "On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n",
       "\n",
       "But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n",
       "\n",
       " OneNote:\n",
       "\n",
       "This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n",
       "\n",
       " PowerPoint:\n",
       "\n",
       "There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n",
       "\n",
       " Outlook:\n",
       "\n",
       "There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n",
       "\n",
       " Publisher:\n",
       "\n",
       "I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n",
       "\n",
       " Access:\n",
       "\n",
       "The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n",
       "\n",
       " Annoyances & Irritants:\n",
       "\n",
       "My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n",

       "The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account.

       "Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed.

       "I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n",
       "\n",
       " Word:\n",
       "\n",
       "The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n",
       "\n",
       "Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application.

       " Excel:\n",
       "\n",
       "On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n",
       "\n",
       "But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n",

       "This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n",
       "\n",
       " PowerPoint:\n",
       "\n",
       "There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n",

       " Outlook:\n",
       "\n",
       "There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n",

It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n",

Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it.

It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n",

My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version.

       "Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n",

       "I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC.

Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n",

Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions. Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 4-star product that can be recommended on the Windows 8 platform.\n",

After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.\n",
       "\n",
       "Things glo has improved upon:\n",
       "\n",
       "++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are \"lenses\" that \"distribute content over a zoomable interface,\" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.\n",
       "\n",
       "++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.\n",
       "\n",
       "++  The user can check out the \"contributors and sources\" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.\n",
       "\n",
       "++  There is a \"Quick Install\" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.\n",
       "\n",
       "++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.\n",
       "\n",
       "++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.
