For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.\n\nIt's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)\n\nAs I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.</td><td>10 20, 2010</td><td>A38NELQT98S4H8</td><td>WB Halper</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5</td><td>1287532800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed.

Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on \"the best way to lay out a site using CSS\" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.\n\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.\n\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\n\nUI - at the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.</td><td>10 18, 2010</td><td>A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</td><td>Grimmy</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A good value</td><td>1287360000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is \"Certified Associate,\" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\n\nWith this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from \"Adobe Certified Instructors\", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.\n\nFor the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a \"test\" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\n\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I've simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you'll be learning on the videos.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n1) HTML Refresher - This is an excellent section for someone who already knows HTML, but could use a refresher in the form of a \"crash course.\"  You'll find a URL overview, an HTML intro (tags, how some browsers read tags differently, and what Dreamweaver \"does behind the scenes).\n\n2) Dreamweaver Introduction - You'll finally be able to learn what WYSIWYG is, you'll be introduced to Dreamweaver Design, Code, and split screens, and the welcome screen.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.\n\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\n\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\n\n  What this is\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\n  - A great overview of using DW\n\nWhat it isn't\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.</td><td>10 12, 2010</td><td>AYUF7YETYOLNX</td><td>Bryan Newman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A Fantastic Overview of Dream Weaver and Web Design in General</td><td>1286841600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I decided (after trying a number of other products) to switch to the gold standard of web site management, Dreamweaver.

DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, it's also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And that's where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in. It very clearly takes you through learning DW so that you can get on with designing web pages.\n\nExcellent addition to my library and excellent companion to Dreamweaver itself.

Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.\n\nThe opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\n\nI'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.\nAt some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it.

Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.\n\nThere are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.\n\nAll in all, this is a great product for the price.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A2WCFDOCS73PNB</td><td>Gadgetman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Excellent value for the price</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Even though I use Dreamweaver a great deal and own several books on the subject, I found this set very helpful. Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.\n\nThe videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (\"Fireworks\" for \"Firefox,\" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.\n\nSince each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the \"Watch and work\" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.\n\nNew features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.\n\nIf you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A14638TGYH7GD9</td><td>Rebecca Haden</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Buy this with your copy of Dreamweaver</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.\n\nI should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\n*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\n* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\n* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\n* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\n* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\n* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.\n* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\n* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\n\nNOT SO POSITIVE:\n* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.\n* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.\n* There is no \"search\" function or \"index.\" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.\n* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\n* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\n\nOn the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\n\nVideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.</td><td>10 21, 2010</td><td>A2VWE5SGNDS8HW</td><td>tachi1</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Competent introduction to Dreamweaver and web principles.</td><td>1287619200</td><td>false</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>0321700945</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>As someone who has just upgraded from Lightroom version 2 to the new version 3, I got this to bring me up to speed on the new features.

You'll progress from the very beginning of setting Lightroom up to importing photos, developing them, exporting them and everything in between. It does not contain everything that anyone would want in an educational program - that would be a practical impossibility. However, this program contains 10 hours of video training: you hear how a procedure occurs and you see how it's done, along with advice and opinion. There's even a testing procedure included and reference booklet. You can also copy selected video tutorials. I've had and have been using Adobe Lightroom for a couple years and recently upgraded to Lightroom 3. I've books written about Lightroom 3 by well known authors but I found reading about it was just a little too tedious and finally decided to find out how to make it work for me. This program works, it did for me and frankly I believe it's the best program available.</td><td>10 7, 2010</td><td>A23E9QQHJLNGUI</td><td>Bill Oterson</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Absolutely the best.</td><td>1286409600</td><td>false</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>0321700945</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a greate collection of videos on the disk.

Personally I found it rather tedious.\n\nI'd like to learn Lightroom because I've owned it for a while. I tried to use it but did not understand it so I went back to using Adobe Bridge, which is think is generally under-appreciated. I love Photoshop but tend to spend a lot of time with it, so the supposed time-saving features of Lightroom would be helpful.\n\nI really hoped this product would make it easy for me to use Lightroom. Unfortunately I had trouble staying alert through more than 3 or 4 lessons at a time, and that much only covers a small portion of the material.  I don't think this is because of the presenters so much as it is the difficulty of covering this sort of material in a video format.\n\nThe Introduction alone consists of 26 videos. It seemed like a commercial for Lightroom rather than a tutorial. Seven of the lessons are devoted to \"What's New\" -- not too relevant for beginners. On the plus side, there were plenty of screen shots to familiarize us with the look of the software.\n\nUnit 2 has 11 video lessons on importing pictures. That gives you an idea on how much detail is here.

The series does an excellent job of not only giving you a general tour and reference to what is available in Lightroom, but also diving into more important aspects that you do not pick up on out of the gate.\n\nWatching the entire video in one sitting is probably not feasible since it's ten hours of content.  In fact, finding the time to watch the entire ten hours at all might be difficult.  Don't be fooled though as any time you invest in going through this video will improve your usage of Lightroom.  It really depends on what you want out of Lightroom.  If you are just wanting some simple organization and editing you won't need this video or certainly won't need all of it.  If you would like to dive into the publishing aspects and really optimizing your workflow, then this would be a good investment for you.</td><td>12 6, 2010</td><td>A10Y058K7B96C6</td><td>midnight122</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Great for beginners or just about any Lightroom user</td><td>1291593600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321700945</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am a long time user of Photoshop Lightroom, from the first version.

It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.\n\nIf you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don't need this video. But if you want more like publishing, converting and optimizing images, I recommend this training video.</td><td>11 15, 2010</td><td>A3V7D0LH8L7BG0</td><td>Spike D.</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>You need to have this..</td><td>1289779200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The \"Learn by Video\" program for Flash CS5 would make a nice alternative to an introductory book - especially for visual learners.  I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.\n\nThere are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.\n\nThe focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the \"Classroom in a Book\" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.\n\nOne thing I got here more clearly than in the \"Classroom in a Book\" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).\n\nOverall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on \"Best Practices\" serves as a useful complement to the \"how to\" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the \"Next Video\" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the \"Next Video\" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. \"Hawaiin\" instead of \"Hawaiian\"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the \"inverseKinematics_start.fla\" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.</td><td>11 27, 2010</td><td>AGVWTYW0ULXHT</td><td>Nate</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on \"best practices\"</td><td>1290816000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.\n\nThe lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.\n\nAs with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.</td><td>10 21, 2010</td><td>A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</td><td>Grimmy</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A good introduction to Flash, with some UI weaknesses</td><td>1287619200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This certified associate courseware comes as a package containing a DVD-ROM plus supplemental written material.

It covers the very basics and this might be off-putting to people with experience using MS Windows.\nThe presentation voices are modulated and interesting. They are personable and the viewer gets an, \"in classroom,\" feel which improved the effectiveness of the lessons for me.  Some people learn better by working along with the instructor. This video course provides the necessary files to do this and complete the tutorial as it is watched.  The narrator leaves plenty of time for this.\n\nFor those who learn best by listening and watching the pace of presentation designed for working along with the presentation it will seem to move slowly.\nThe supplemental material is a good reference for after you have completed the video lesson.  The video creates a foundation of basic skills needed and the reference reinforces the lesson.  The materials are a good reference to use while one is using the program.\n\nAll in all I found this lesson to be a useful introduction to using Flash CS5. This course helped me to learn skills that I can use in web development. For people like myself who learn better, especially at the begining in with a presentation format this provides a faster route to getting foundation skills to build upon with reference texts.</td><td>10 10, 2010</td><td>A31N0XY2UTB25C</td><td>Stephanie Sullivan</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Learn Adobe Flash Professional CS5 by Video</td><td>1286668800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719824</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This was the first Learn by Video series course that I've used, and I'm very impressed with the production.

There's also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.\n\nAgain, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.). This is helpful if you want to view the videos and work hands-on on your computer, although the small screen would be difficult.  The DVD also includes a collection of asset files that correspond with the lessons.\n\nIf you are a visual learner or don't prefer thick technical books, then this video course would be a good low-cost alternative. Don't expect to be a Flash expert when you complete this course, but at least you'll understand the basic concepts.</td><td>01 29, 2011</td><td>A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9</td><td>Dave Edmiston</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Good Intro to Flash CS5</td><td>1296259200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>Excel:\nDoes not allow you to copy and paste sometimes.

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.</td><td>10 29, 2015</td><td>A1MRPX3RM48T2I</td><td>Trenton Bennett</td><td>null</td><td>Times have changed</td><td>1446076800</td><td>true</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have this running on my Macbook Air and two HP laptops.

The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels.  And the quality of the software and syncing interface makes me willing to pay for this.\n\nFinally, at this time through the Bing search engine you are able to get 100 GB of free One Drive space which has made it so I can keep all of my documents in the cloud, accessible and synced across all devices.

There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.\n\nInstallation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.\n\nIn use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).</td><td>10 17, 2013</td><td>AHNHLGKIZ2N3B</td><td>D.

But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.\n\nSo imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).\n\nAnd to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.</td><td>10 16, 2013</td><td>A16QODENBJVUI1</td><td>Robert Moore</td><td>null</td><td>A kinder, gentler Microsoft</td><td>1381881600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>First let me say the updates that have occured in Office over the past few updates have been GREAT!

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.\n\nAn added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.\n\nInstallation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.\n\nIt did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected.

In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.\n\nThere are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.\n\nPlease note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.\n\nHere are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n\n Likes:\n\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\n\n Rants & Irritants:\n\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n\n Installation:\n\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n\n SkyDrive:\n\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n\n Summary:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review.

Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\n\nAs far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\n\nOffice 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\n\nMicrosoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.</td><td>09 27, 2013</td><td>A4U27URFECK1U</td><td>The Technologist</td><td>null</td><td>A Lack Of Color Makes A Boring Interface</td><td>1380240000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0763855553</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>It's really hard to get any quantity of work down without Microsoft Office.

I actually had to uninstall then reinstall.  I also tried loading this to a Mac, same issues.  However, between the Win 8 attempt and the Mac install, I tried it on a Windows 7: everything installed like a dream.  I have no idea why this is fussy on some systems.

I use Office on my desktop computer for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, so there is no advantage here with Office 365.\n\nThe features of Office 365 are no better than before, but again Microsoft changed the layout of the menus and where everything is. It's not hard to figure out, but I would rather just buy a standalone product that I don't have to pay for over and over for minor improvements.

I did what I thought Microsoft wanted of me - downloaded the demo copy from them, and then entered the keycode. I now have a working copy, but did I just pay for the privilege?\n\nApart from that, this is the best way to buy Office. You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won't guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.\n\nI like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I'm used to things that people get upset about. For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don't like. I find it hard to recommend anything else, and as long as Microsoft keep offering this at a low price it's a no-brainer.\n\nAll I dislike about this is the installation problem I've mentioned.

For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive. From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).\n\nThe public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close. Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo. I would like to see one more choice: \"Direct Link,\" which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything.\n\nI've also installed Office 365 onto my wife's MacBook and her iPhone.

It is important to note that you will need to use the Microsoft account you used to register the software to install the software on the 5 computers.  There is no option to send other household members a link to install the software.  You do not need to stay logged once the software is installed.

After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.\n\nThings glo has improved upon:\n\n++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are \"lenses\" that \"distribute content over a zoomable interface,\" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.\n\n++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.\n\n++  The user can check out the \"contributors and sources\" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.\n\n++  There is a \"Quick Install\" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.\n\n++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.\n\n++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this \"revolutionary new Bible\" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.\n\nGLO features:\n\n++  450+ Virtual Tours\n  These are 360-degree tours of \"modern-day and re-created\" ancient biblical locations.\"\n\n++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos\n  You'll be able to enjoy the \"In His Shoes\" HD interactive documentary.\n\n++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos\n  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.\n\n++  7,500+ Articles\n  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan\n\nTake for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.\n\n++  650+ Works of Art\n\n++  Integration with the best web content\n\n++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program\n\n++  Concise, compact organization through five \"lenses\"\n\n++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study\n\nLENSES:\n\nBIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.\n\nTIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation\n\nMyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and \"reading plans.\"\n\nMEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.\n\nATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger \"picture\" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.\n\nTOPICAL:  Here you can \"quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.\"\n\nThere are three DVDs in this packet.

If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.  If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously.</td><td>06 1, 2011</td><td>ACJT8MUC0LRF0</td><td>D.

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.\n\nMany have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.\n\nThe initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.\n\nThis product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.\n\nThe best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a very good program.  Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think it's worth the effort.

I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.

There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.\n\nGLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.\n\nGLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.\n\nBe forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.\n\nThe one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.\n\nI'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.\n\nGLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration. I also believe a tutorial is would have been sorely helpful so you get the most bang for you buck rather than just wandering around.</td><td>08 25, 2011</td><td>A3TPNC3TKGCCEI</td><td>Ms. Rocki</td><td>null</td><td>Visually Stunning!

Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.\n\nCheck out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.\n\nThis program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:\n\nAudible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.\n\nA few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.\n\nI wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.\n\nAnd, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.\n\nIn my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!\n\nThis program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.\n\nUPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop. Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app. I'm loving this on the IPod.</td><td>07 9, 2011</td><td>A1PI8VBCXXSGC7</td><td>Lynn</td><td>null</td><td>Interactive, Multi-media Bible  provides a wealth of information..Update: I just added Glo to my IPod Touch</td><td>1310169600</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>0982697813</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I got this installed on my computer, and it was almost overwhelming how much data and information that is presented.

Still, if you dive into it, you're gonna experience the Bible in a completely new way.  Not that this product is changing the word of God, but just presenting it in a new fashion.  In this day and age of multimedia everything, and online that, and Twitter this...  It's kind of inevitable that a multimedia bible like this would exist.\n\nOne issue though.  Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive.  There are three DVD's in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1.  That's not too bad.  But if you want to do the \"full\" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.  I've installed multi disc programs before, and they haven't taken anywhere near that amount of time.

Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.\n\nWillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.\n\nI wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my \"final intentions\" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say \"give it all to so-and-so\".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.\n\nI think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the \"list price\" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.\n\nBy the way, if you buy this toward the end of 2011, note that the \"free updates\" are only good through the end of December.</td><td>07 31, 2011</td><td>A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ</td><td>PhotoGraphics</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Not very sophisticated</td><td>1312070400</td><td>false</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>1413313701</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>This is the third version of Quicken Willmaker Plus I have used.  I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)\n\nThis 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.\n\nOther than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.\n\nFor most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.\n\nAnother thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.\n\nMost likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use.  I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.  But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, I'm going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community.</td><td>07 9, 2011</td><td>A5JLAU2ARJ0BO</td><td>Old-and-Wise</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Solid estate planning product, but living trust feature not integrated</td><td>1310169600</td><td>false</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>1413313701</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have to say that this software is great to save yourself a lot of legal fees.

I wanted to use this to update a new will, since my old one is about ten years old, but ended up just typing the new one in because my old form is much better for where I live.  If, however, you don't want to hire a lawyer and you don't know how to pull together every form you might need for end of life legal dispositions (will, health care directive, etc.) and you don't have a big or complicated life, this will do the trick nicely and save you a lot of money.

Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I'd suggest buying their books instead.\n\nThe program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.\n\nIn these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.\n\nMany of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.\n\nIncluded in the program are \"checklists\"  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as \"How to Form an LLC\" and \"How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting\".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.\n\nMost frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated \"Book Reader\" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, also included with the program is a printed book called \"Your Little Legal Companion\" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as \"Moving in with your Lover\" and \"Getting Old.\" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.\n\nUpon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book \"101 Law Forms for Personal Use\".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.\n\nCombined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.

IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document.\n- no index of documents\n- could not find any way to export information to other file formats.\n\nOverall, this collection of forms and books presents a great value that can save you money on your first use, and I'd highly recommend it for other small business owners.</td><td>12 26, 2010</td><td>A16RI68PS6T5CA</td><td>Gadget Geek</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Do your own homework!</td><td>1293321600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1413313728</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The pre-made contracts and forms are a blessing in disguise.  They are certainly very useful to get you going and give you an idea of what you may need to have in an agreement on many issues, however, if it's something really serious I wouldn't blindly use the forms here but edit them very carefully or have a lawyer look at them for you.\n\nOne really good feature of this product are the fully sercheable books which is really nice to keyword something in and find as much information as you can.  You can google it too, however, you have to sort out a lot of useless information on Google, here, it's all organized and professional!\n\nAlso:  buying this instead of the books individually certainly saves you a bundle, so might as well get them like this, sercheable, than in print.</td><td>12 23, 2010</td><td>A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET</td><td>Robert</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Very useful</td><td>1293062400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1413313728</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Before reading on, please note that the newer, updated version (2012) is now available for less --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Quicken-Legal-Business-Pro-2012/dp/B005CELLZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Quicken Legal Business Pro 2012</a>. (Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)\n\nThat said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:\n\nFirst, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.\n\nI will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).\n\nAll of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.\n\nI don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.\n\nAlso, none of the forms were usable \"as-is\" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).\n\nNonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.</td><td>01 26, 2012</td><td>A1HOLE9R6WPT85</td><td>Mad Max</td><td>List(null,  Box, null,  PC Disc, null, null, null)</td><td>Really for individuals & small business ...

The interface takes some getting used to, and the search engine leaves a bit to be desired.  The program can also be a little slow to respond, particularly when it first loads.  Drilling down to specifics is not as easy as idly thumbing through issues, and thumbing through issues can also be a bit tedious.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that the National Geographic Society are not Wikipedia:  information presented here was the well researched and chronicled *at the time of printing*--older issues will not be brought up to date with the world's latest discoveries.  This collection exists simply as a way to see the massive collection of the National Geographic Society that spans over a century of traveling the world and absorbing its information.

Every one of us, from somewhere, remembers reading them as a child.  Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed.  Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world.\nI am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.  You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image.  The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either.  I have several of these collections and cannot comment of how a first time user will find this.  There are better interfaces but this is not an impossible one and it is fully supported.\nIs it worth it?  That depends on you.  Can you lose yourself in looking at pictures of Europe in 1925?  Would you want to read about the Pacific Northwest in the 1930?  Can you spend a couple of hours looking at advertisement of products that no longer exist?

Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).\n\nNote that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!\n\nThe developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a \"copy everything to disk\" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now.

The real guts of the course is what they call the Mp3/iPod Audio Disk.  This is where they go over verb conjugation and such, basically the rules of Spanish.  There isn't any pretty interface, but I found this one CD alone worth the purchase price.\nThe \"Who is Oscar Lake\" CD game is really lame.  They could have just omitted it.  As I said, the other GUI CDs are OK, and worth going through for the most part.  The Level 1 Disk 2 CD looks like it was left over from the 90's.  I really didn't get too much out of it and it did appear to be information that was covered elsewhere.  There are several different looks to the CDs, so it really looks like they have just bundled programs that they compiled over the years.  I also noticed that some of the translations are not 100% accurate.  For instance, the Spanish phrasing would obviously contain the words Madrid or Barcelona, but the English translations would not.  This kind of made me wonder why.\n\nBased primarily of the price point, I do recommend this program as a starting point for learning Spanish.

After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.\n\nMany people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.\n\nWithout a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.\n\nThe third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.\n\nThere is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.\n\nBut I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the \"vos\" (as opposed to \"vosotros\") is used instead of the \"tu\" form.\nOne of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.\n\nSome other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.\n\nTo speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.\n\nThe last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>.

The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they don't seem to update anything. I've used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version. The graphics are dated and unattractive. The videos/animation slow and not fluid. This looks like they took the same product they've been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate. I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing. That sounds are still hollow sounding as well and modern day clip-art looks more attractive. The games/learning tools are the same but not expanded.

The program includes, in recommended order of use:\n\n1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases.

In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me. We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis.\n\nThis program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older!

It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject. Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:\n\nI received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.\n\nThere were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.\n\nI'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.\n\nIf you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that. Or if you just want a nice introduction to Spanish, to see if it's a language that you'd enjoy learning this product would also be excellent and the price is very reasonable. But to actually learn to converse with Spanish speakers, I think you need something more.</td><td>11 24, 2009</td><td>A3S3R88HA0HZG3</td><td>PT Cruiser</td><td>List(null,  CD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Good introduction to Spanish</td><td>1259020800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>1600775411</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>In my line of work, it's a great idea to learn another language, and Spanish being the main lingo outside of English in my area, the Instant Immersion program seemed like the ticket.\n\nIt may very well be.

The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).\n\nThe Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.\n\nIn its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.\n\nWhen you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's \"search\" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy \"Virtual Notecards\". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.\n\nThe new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.\n\nPerhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.\n\nRegrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.\n\nSpeaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.\n\nThe Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.\n\nThe Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.\n\nThe Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.\n\nThe Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the \"Personal Brain\" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.\n\nThe Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, \"how to\" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.\n\nIronically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).\n\nStill, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.\n\nThe current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.\n\nThe Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.\n\nSome minor gripes:\n\nThe atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?\n\nDespite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.\n\nBut that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.\n\nWith the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

This also may explain why the game is shorter; I'm guessing they realized that the game would be better if it took longer, so the other two games (\"Stay Tuned For Danger\" and \"Message In a Haunted Mansion\") have more playing time.  On the other hand, because it is shorter, it's also easier, so this might be better for slightly younger girls than the other two.  Also, this game requires 2 CDs--you have to switch back and forth.  This was annoying at first, but soon became bearable.  But really, this game was a lot of fun.  Even with the less-than-stellar graphics, there were still a lot of word puzzles and things to explore.  This game and \"Message\" both have slide puzzles, though, which I can't stand.

While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.\n\nThis game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of \"Light of Our Love\" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...\n\nThe plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.\n\nThe quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.\n\nSadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.\n\nThe graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).\n\nThe characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where \"Light of Our Love\" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of \"Light of Our Love\". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive \"suspects\". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.\n\nThe music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect \"New York City\" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.\n\nWhile Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, it's a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If you've played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please don't do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story that's worth experiencing. I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, here's to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!</td><td>05 25, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Stay Tuned for Improvement</td><td>1306281600</td><td>false</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>B00003IRBV</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>NOTE:I am posting this review on both product pages for this game since Amazon has the same game listed as two different products.\n\nAfter getting stuck on this game for a while, I had put it away to try later. After I tried it again and managed to finish it, this game quickly became one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. \"Stay Tuned for Danger\" may be one of the older games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also one of the best.\n\nStory-A soap opera star has called you to New York to figure out who is sending death threats to her co star. It soon becomes evident that someone is out to hurt or kill him as the threats elevate and some near fatal accidents occur. It is up to you to figure out who is causing it all.\n\nGraphics-Although the graphics are much better than the first game, they still aren't perfect. They are in 3D, and the 3D is done pretty well. The characters are also pretty good, but they tend to freeze in awkward positions as they are done talking, only resuming movement when they start to talk again. But, overall, the graphics are pretty good.\n\nSound-The music in the game is OK, but it really doesn't stand out as being catchy. The background sounds are good in the game, and the voice acting is good, too. Some of the voice actors sound like they were really into their parts while some sounded like they were bored.\n\nGameplay-This game, like all games in the Nancy Drew adventure series, is a first-person point-and-click game. You will move around between 3 main locations while solving puzzles, questioning suspects, and finding clues. The puzzles in this game are very innovative and may require some serious thought to solve them, but although they are a challenge, they are still really fun. In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them. You can also ask them for help which is a way to get hints for what to do next.\n\nLength-It's a pretty good-sized game. There's a lot to do throughout the game, and it's not necessarily very obvious what to do next. The game should probably last several hours at least.\n\nAll in all, this is probably one of the most challenging and fun games in the Nancy Drew series. It lasts a while, and it incorporates great adventure gaming elements into the gameplay.

These are my observations.\n\n1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.\n\n2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that \"just works\" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.\n\n3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.\n\n4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.\n\nWindows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and \"just works\". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.</td><td>09 23, 2006</td><td>A16UJ76AFPJGEX</td><td>B.

A lot of Microsoft staff was there. One quick note is that there were two types of staff. One wore red shirts, and the others wore blue shirts. The whole day seminar/presentation started with an explanation of, \"If you have a technical question, ask one of the Microsoft staff in a red shirt, if you have a sales or marketing question, ask a blue shirt\". I got a charge out of that. Sales people are enamored with what the software can do for you, and the technical staff is enamored in how it can do it.\n\nWhat I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesn't hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.\n\nWhat W2000 does is amazing. Not only can an outside manufacturer not be able to change system files, if you go in and delete a system file, then exit out of the folder, then go back in, sure enough the system file you just deleted was automatically restored when you exited out of the folder.\n\nAnother point I wanted to make; the overwhelming advantage of using W2000 over XP when installing in an older machine is that it is compatible with a lot of the older hardware.\n\n  Here is the problem: You install XP, and up comes a warning that your hardware is not compatible, or needs drivers loaded in order to work. The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility.\n\n XP is built on the Windows 2000 platform.\n\nI just built a new machine, so I installed XP Pro on it, and I also picked up a copy of W2000 from an independent seller here at Amazon, and loaded it on my AMD K62-500 for the network. Although I did have one video card that didn't have a W2000 driver, so I changed that very inexpensively with a great 128meg video card on sale with rebates for $29. So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time. You can leave a machine sitting for a couple of hours and not have it respond poorly when you come back to it, and have to reboot. No more blue screen error reports, having to reboot and run scan disk.\n\nOn my new XP machine, I had a bad program loaded, and when would run it, I would get a millisecond error screen, with an instant shut down, then it would reboot without having to run scan disk. I am assuming that since you can't mess with system files, no errors are created. I removed the program, which was a Mickey mouse add on included with a hardware bundle.\n\nWindows 2000 pro rocks.

I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.

The BOOT recovery did not work as documented, and in order to recover, you have to bring up recovery console, which is undocumented.  Installing Service Pack 1 patch the system but partitions over 8GB is not reconized, and MS Knowledge base suggested actions did not fix the problem.  At installation, it wriped out the Master Boot Record clean, which make me lose the access to number of different operating systems.  Windows Exporer Picture Browser format has been changed, browsing directory between Windows 98 and Windows 2000 would currupt the picture database, and crash the exporer.  After installation, running setup second time marks drive as \"Unreconized or Damaged\" partition even if the partition table is in perfect condition.  Once service pack 1 is installed, the system refuse to format these drives due to inability to access drive over 8GB.  Installed Microsoft Visual Studio and Watcom C++ v11 for programming work and the whole system went down after reboot with stop 0x7B, Inaccessible boot device error message.  The system wouldn't even boot in safe mode.  Back to system recovery console again! Install Driver for Symbios 53c785 SCSI controller, GeForce Video Driver, and adding different SCSI contoller sent me back to recovery console again.  The OS appears to be too unstable!</td><td>12 22, 2000</td><td>AE95Z3K6GVIC3</td><td>S.

Lockups and crashes were pretty common. What a  difference W2K has made! I did a complete reinstall, something that I  definitely recommend if at all possible. Most computers these days can boot  from the CD, which makes this infinitely more easy to do than in the past.  Installation went flawlessly for me...then I ran into the problems others  have mentioned regarding drivers and various programs not working. It's not  as bad as you might think though. At this point, the OS has been out long  enough that most manufacturers are providing drivers. The only one I ran  into a problem with was my CD-R driver software, there was no free upgrade  from Adaptec, so I was stuck paying $100 to get something that worked. 1  star out of 5 to them for their lack of providing a decent option for W2K  users. Other than that, I definitely recommend this upgrade. In addition to  stability, it has a lot of nice features and improvements that make the  Windows experience even better. Only main complaint I have is the price. To  those who still think Microsoft is not a monopoly, I would point to this  product as a perfect example of how the price for their upgrades keeps  going up, while other software keeps going down.

For those of you who are not  familiar with Dramatica, it is a creative writing tool which helps you  decide where your story is going by asking you certain questions about  plot, themes, character motivation, and story dynamics. It offers you two  ways to do this: the short version (50 questions), which only takes you a  day, or the long version (200+ questions), which could take you up to a  week.

For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait? Its not easy let me tell you!  When trying to chose an icon to represent my protagonist I had a choice between X-Men and small cheap looking pictures of ugly cartoons.

I'm not a dummy, but I would like to be able to use the software without having to refer to the HELP.\n\nOverall, I LIKE Dramatica Pro. But its by no means an easy App to work with.

This is the hard part to Dramatica, since  ideal prior art probably doesn't exist, from which to refer,  except for the possibility of future works skilfully created with Dramatica.\nNow there's a chicken or the egg paradox.</td><td>10 29, 2003</td><td>A1PPD5TOR6VVYV</td><td>S Smyth</td><td>null</td><td>Ahead of the curve.</td><td>1067385600</td><td>false</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>B00004TYCR</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Dramatica is a way to organise your thoughts about theme, plot-theme, and characters into a story form as opposed to something that isn't.\nUsing its own terminology allied to templates, the user is required to fill in a set of questionnaires, which act as the input from which their story is distilled. This can be amended at will if the user feels that they are being too boxed in.\nThe end result is more easily managed than stacks of cards and papers. It can also be easily shared with other Dramatica users by distributing files across the internet to each other (given that version sync isn't an issue).\nIt's like having a collaborator in front of you all the time - if needed - with regard to the structure, but won't be of any help with poor prose, prose-style, bad dialogue, lack of motivation or any other essential aspects that the writer would need to know about. A badly written story, which is bang-on structurally, as far as Dramatica is concerned, is not  a useful end product. In other words, the user would need to be a decent writer in the first place, using Dramatica as a tool to refine and focus their work, and not regard it an easy way out. It's not.\nSo bearing that in mind, Dramatica shouldn't disappoint so long as  the user is prepared for the discipline of story writing, in its strictest sense.</td><td>08 20, 2003</td><td>A1PPD5TOR6VVYV</td><td>S Smyth</td><td>null</td><td>Very useful tool.</td><td>1061337600</td><td>false</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>B00004W62O</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great extension to the Windows 98 line of operating systems.

A really fun, exciting, game for girls -- that DOESN'T come in a pink box, for heaven's sake.  As a video game fan growing up in the 80s, I noticed that there were very few \"girl-oriented\" games out there.  There were plenty for boys; and a few for both sexes, like \"Tetris\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\", and, of course, the ever-popular \"Mario Bros.\" series.  But even the Mario games favored boys.  There were always more male characters to choose from than females (there'd be, maybe one girl, the Princess, who sported a pink dress.) And the games JUST for girls would be, like, Atari's \"Strawberry Shortcake\" game, where you'd get to switch around everybody's outfits.  Now, in the year 2001, there's plenty of girl software out there, but I'm not interested in PC Diaries, where girls can record their innermost secrets and keep them locked up with a voice-activated password.  I've outgrown being interested in designing clothes for Barbie.  (They need a game where you can design a Barbie house!  Now that would be cool.)  Not that there's anything wrong with those games; it's just that they're very tame, and some girls, like myself, want adventure.  Believe it or not, the box for this Nancy Drew game sports the phrase \"For adventurous girls, ages 10 and up.\"  That's me! (A bit over 10, but who's counting?)  But enough with the introductions -- let me describe the game.  It's an adventure game; \"Choose Your Own Adventure\"-esque.  Nancy is staying in a mansion that's someday going to be a Bed & Breakfast.  There's a problem though -- a bunch of accidents have been happening.  Your job, as Nancy, is to find clues, solve puzzles, talk to people, and solve the mystery of who's responsible for the accidents.  But you soon discover that you have a SECOND mystery to deal with.  This game requires logic, patience, and a curious mind.  What amazed me was how long the game took to complete; there's really a lot to do.  But after about 14-16 hours of game play, I have finished the game, and I'm sad.  So -- I think I'll order the other two Nancy Drew games that are on amazon! ;)  Please, DreamCatcher games and Her Interactive -- keep these coming!  I want more Nancy Drew games.  I've always loved the books; and fans of the books might even laugh at how closely the game resembles the books in some instances.  Just like the Nancy Drew books changed the world of adventure books for girls; this game is a true icon of the progress in Girls' Games that's come along in the last decade.

But I've learned not to pre-judge the older games; it's the plot and puzzles that drive these games, not the graphics. That said, this game was not mind-blowing. If you want to go for a classic Nancy Drew title, I would suggest the game that came after this, Treasure in the Royal Tower (#4). I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.\n\nI thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said \"20+ hours of gameplay\", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered \"educational\". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like \"Oh great, here comes another history lesson.\"\n\nCHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.\n\nThe graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.\n\nPhone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.\n\nSETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.\n\nPUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle \"in the corner\". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like \"Maybe you should take a look at the library again!\" it was more \"Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf.\" Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.\n\nENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 4\nCharacters: 3.5\nSetting: 4.5\nPuzzles: 4.5\nChallenge: 2.5\nEnding: 3.5\n= 22.5 divided by 6 = 3.75 rounded to 4 stars</td><td>06 11, 2013</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>The Message is Worth Reading</td><td>1370908800</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I think this game is when the company really got into it's groove. The first two were fun, don't get me wrong, but it's with this one that we really start to get into the intrigue that I love about these games so much. This also sets up for the ever-present light spook factor that is present from here until Blackmoor.\n\nI played this game as a child, put it away for a few years, then pulled it out and played it again recently. I could still recite the games poem perfectly. \"Listen my child to this story of dreams...\" I loved that. I think I annoyed my mother with how many times I repeated back when I first received the game in 2001/2002.\n\nFor people looking to get into the series, I might recommend this to you, but make sure you get another game (preferably from the first eleven, if you want a true example of what this company can do) to accompany it. It does have it's issues, since it is so old and only the third game they made, but it's also an extremely satisfying game.</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>It's a classic.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Message in a Haunted Mansion is the third Nancy Drew game, and far superior compared to the first two. This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal \"Nancy Drew case formula\". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as \"there must always be four suspects\" and \"there must always be a long-lost treasure\".\n\nRose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?\n\nThe plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first \"haunted house\" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.\n\nI will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.\n\nEven though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.\n\nThe graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.\n\nThe characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.\n\nOne wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.\n\nThe music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.\n\nMessage in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.</td><td>05 26, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>The Message: This Game Rocks!</td><td>1306368000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>After success with the first two games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, the creators tried to step up the suspense with a scarier mystery.

Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.\n\nGraphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.\n\nSound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.\n\nGameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.\n\nLength-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.\n\nOverall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE-There is also a version of this game available for the Game Boy Advance.</td><td>12 12, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Another good Nancy Drew game</td><td>1260576000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000050HEI</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Message\" is the first Nancy Drew Pc game that I have tried and I was very favorably impressed. The game is literate: it is not directed towards very young players per se and young people will have to read well to appreciate the many tidbits of literature scattered around the Victorian mansion. I am 76 and could read them quite well. :)\n\nThe sets are beautifully rendered in elegant color and the Chinese antiques are a feast for the eye. The characters are well animated with gestures that are completely natural. The voices are good, too.\n\n\"Message\" is Nirvana for the Point and Click enthusiasts. No expert mouse maneuvers are required such as jumping into a fast moving bucket in \"Uru.\" Nothing is timed. We take our PC games very seriously and it is an affront to the ego when one isn't fast enough to perform an intricate mouse gyration. In fact, I could get stage fright just looking at a high ledge I knew I had to vault upon and therefore couldn't perforn at all.\n\n\"Message\" is scary. This is by no means a plain dish of vanilla. There are creaks and groans and shadowy forms passing in the night. Atmosphere plus. And you can wander around just as you wish poking into this and that and getting a delicious scary thrill when a curtain suddenly billows into your face with hissing sound.\n\nCaptions are provided which are very helpful as the characters speak rapidly. All in all \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" is a very solid piece of work for all ages.</td><td>07 21, 2006</td><td>A22F3BWM7RAHDA</td><td>P. B.

Is a ghost behind it all - as one of the owners believes, or is one of the hired help or even one of the owners to blame for all that's going on?  And if it's one of \"the living\", what reason do they have to cause all of this havoc?  Your job as Nancy Drew, teen detective will be to answer these questions, and get to the bottom of it.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed (or is enjoying) the Nancy Drew series.

Nancy is staying with a friend and helping her fix up a Victorian mansion that she is going to turn into a B&B, except strange accidents keep happening that delay the grand opening. Is the house really haunted?\nThe only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with \"Treasure in the Royal Tower.\" But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the sance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.\nThere are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me.\nOne of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really weren't many places to explore. You can't leave the house, and you only have access to your room and one other room, the attic, the dining room, parlor, and basement. I was hoping for more rooms/secret passageways to explore. Not having more locations really cut down on the game's length/replayability.\nOverall, \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" is a fun outing for detectives: a chance to explore a spooky haunted house, gather clues, learn about Chinese art and writing, and dig up clues about a timeless love story and hidden treasure.</td><td>04 6, 2003</td><td>A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</td><td>Bundt Lust</td><td>List(null,  Video Game, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Fun, but confusing</td><td>1049587200</td><td>false</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>B000050ZRE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am very satisfied with the purchase of this wireless router.\nThe setup took just a few minutes to complete the setup wizard and after that everything worked from the first time, perfectly.\nI have now wireless connectivity throughout the whole house.

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This \"smart-switch\" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.\n\nDesign:\nOne of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.\n\nThe click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.\n\nThe 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.\n\nThe 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.\n\nThe interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no \"power brick\" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.\n\nThe included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.\n\nConfiguration:\nI downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.\n\n' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.\n' Change the password - The default password is \"password\", so change it to something better!\n\nThe Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.\n\nThe advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:\n' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)\n' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)\n' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).\n' Port by port Rate limiting\n' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a \"disable\" setting to turn a port off if desired)\n' Port by port Broadcast Filtering\n' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)\n' Multicast control via IGMP snooping\n' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)\n\nNote: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n\nMost users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n\nGreen Power Use:\nThe 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n\nSupport:\nI did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n\nThe switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n\nI had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.\n\nI'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.\n\nHope this helps someone!</td><td>04 21, 2015</td><td>A31N0XY2UTB25C</td><td>Stephanie Sullivan</td><td>List( 0.4243608529, null, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Outstanding DESIGN, Feature RICH, Easily MANAGED, Great SUPPORT, GREEN</td><td>1429574400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000050ZRE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Item came quickly, exactly as described, and a great price.\nWay cheaper from this seller than other places online.\nEasy to add modules makes this switch extremely flexible and future-proof</td><td>04 21, 2015</td><td>A3RK4C2I5SPZNO</td><td>JayB</td><td>List( 0.0811504547, null, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>and a great price.

I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n\nInstallation\n\nYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n\nHardware\n\nAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n\nThe array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n\nOne HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n\nI did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n\nA nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n\nDuring my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.</td><td>03 26, 2012</td><td>A2UL0DVTM8KVNV</td><td>R.

I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.

Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.\n\nI have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.

This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says \"T7Hub\" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for \"permanent\" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.

If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.</td><td>12 19, 2007</td><td>A37VWMG8U0OP41</td><td>Eric Thorson</td><td>List( 0.0986190179, null, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Expensive but worth it for my uses!</td><td>1198022400</td><td>true</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>B000050ZRE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Easy to install on XP machine, drivers worked great.\n\nLoaded quickly and easily, and worked!\n\nWhat else could you ask for?</td><td>11 21, 2007</td><td>A2E6P8E66HNRRC</td><td>R.

I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.\n\nThat device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).\n\nI wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.\n\nA bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.\n\nSetup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).\n\nAnother bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.\n\nThe downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive \"ethernet to Wi-Fi\" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.\n\nThe PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang \"g\") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps \"turbo\" mode in 802.11a!

I had some very weird things happen with 2000 such as its not publishing to the web on the index page unless I also saved it in Notepad.  All the bugs are gone in 2002 plus it is much easier to use.  I use it for everything, rarely using Word, Office and so forth.  My two major tools for editing and writing are Front Page and super Notepad instead.  I am going to learn Dreamweaver next term at the college where I teach because I am finally ready to move on and learn more about professional  web design.  Besides, I can now read and write html so I am not as utterly dependent on Front Page as I once was.  If you don't know any html coding, the basis of all web pages, Front Page is the program for you.  I also do all my image editing in Photoshop so don't even need that function in Front Page.  Dreamweaver is the industry standard instead of Front Page yet Front Page is the ordinary user's program of choice.  The reason for this is that you can know very little about computers and still make a website with Front Page.  It even made publishing websites idiot proof by using Front Page Server extensions with many web host providers.  Thus, one can totally skip learning ftp protocol by using Front Page server extensions instead.  If someone wants to go professionally into web page design, this is not the product, Dreamweaver is.  People who already are professionals in the computer industry or in web design tell me they don't like Front Page.  I think the reason is that since they don't need (or want) Front Page to do their work for them, they desire a program which gives them a much freer hand.  For the average computer user though, that is all pie in the sky, beyond their reach, and Front Page 2002 will more than do the job for them.</td><td>11 28, 2002</td><td>AW3VZ5O895LRK</td><td>carol irvin</td><td>null</td><td>Huge Improvement Over 2000</td><td>1038441600</td><td>false</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>B00005AFI2</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft.

It behaved as if I had never unloaded it the first time.  My alloted number of uses (before activation) decreased so something is still in there saying it was on there before (yes, yes, yes...in the registry).  Ok, Bill wants a new mansion so he is trying to prevent piracy.  I can understand that.  HOWEVER, my next concern is realllllyyy big.  In ME, you can set a restore point.  This restore point allows you to reconfigure your PC to a point from the past.  This is present just in case a new program you load has some problems, etc....  Now remember, ME is Mr. Gate's program just like Publisher.  I had to reformat my hard drive (thanks to Microsoft's Encarta Reference Library).  My system was fresh as a daisy.  I re-loaded Publisher out of curiosity to see what would happen.  I created a restore point PRIOR to loading it.  I didn't activate it because I didn't want it.  I unloaded it.  Just to test the system, I used my restore function.  If you are following me carefully, you can tell I have already made two changes since creating the restore point:  loading and unloading Publisher.  Guess What!?!  ME wouldn't allow the restoration because NOTHING HAD CHANGED ON MY PC!  HELLO???  I loaded and unloaded a program; I consider that a change.  Let's say Publisher had a problem and didn't work.  In order to get it off my PC, I would have to do ANOTHER format for my hard drive.  That, my friends, is scary.  And to add on to another person's review.  That person was incorrect when he/she said you could only have it on two PC's and would be out of luck if one crashed.

This time, Nancy Drew is snowed in at a modern-day castle in Wisconsin. She'll meet some strange people, sneak through creepy secret passages, and find beautiful trinkets and treasures ... not without the usual dangers, of course... Nancy Drew can't really avoid those.  There will always be an evil villain trying to do her in.  But hey, it's all in good fun.  If you've played the other Nancy Drew games, this is more of the same.  Most similar to \"Message In A Haunted Mansion\" (in my opinion), this game offers puzzles that are similar to puzzles in the first 3 games, but with one or two totally original ones.  Other than a few surprises, there's nothing in here that's really superior to the other games; I'd say they are all pretty equal.  Still, another Nancy Drew adventure is a good time waiting to happen.  It took me about 12 hours to complete on the junior level, though the box claims it can take you 20.

She is on the trail of a missing journal of Marie Antoinette's that would lead to a sacred treasure hidden by the ill-fated queen back in the 18th century. Her sanctuary was the Chteau Rochemont in France relocated & rebuilt by a chocolate milk tycoon in America.  I found it generally interesting to be able to explore the monstrosity that was the castle, but later became irritated by the tasks that had me zipping all over the place with a clunky interface.\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 88\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nDexter Egan: This was one of the more interesting characters that HER has ever produced as it showed the light and dark side of a man growing up as an adopted child by the millionaire, Ezra Wickford. Ezra had such affection for the boy Dexter [spelling bee champion, volunteer work during WW2 era]  until he felt he could no longer trust him with his future estate based on criminal fraud convictions. Great plot line and I loved the two journals in the secret study!\n\nJacques Brunais: He was sappy right from the start! I was very surprised that HER had the character end relations with Nancy on such a horrible note, but I actually LIKED that story derivative!  It showed the live emotions of irrational people [like in real life].\n\nLisa Ostrum: Usually when a shady past is shoved in your face early in the storyline, that is a sign that this isn't the culprit.  I had Lisa pegged as my # 1 suspect only because the other characters were pressed into showing their flaws throughout the adventure too thoroughly and I had reasons to think they HAD problems, but they weren't directly related to the vandalism. Tara V. Smith [who voiced Lisa] did a fine job, but it sounded rather cartoonish also [like a Peanuts character] and I found it hard to take this photojournalist seriously.\n\nProfessor Beatrice Hotchkiss: God, this woman was something else. I loved the HER comedy bit with the fifty chicken legs and probably would never had done most of  the chores she asked out of shock she would ever impose this on me.  I doubt I would have been so forthcoming with her as the ND did, because she was just as much a suspect as anyone else there.\n\nNed/Bess/George: The voice actors [Claire Gallagher & Maureen Nelson] sounded like they were reading scripts because half of the dialogue didn't flow naturally, but the written dialogue did make me laugh.  Lani Minella actually laughed in this one which is a rare event in ND games. You can check her talent out on a youtube video I recently found! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm1BGVfqWC0\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nThe score was an excellent rendition of a classic, upscale French Society in the Age Of Reason.  It's light, lilting works trickled along amidst fine backings from harpsichords & strings.  The sound effects were adequate and the castle scenery was a solid job by the designers for the year it was made.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 88\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I didn't find many in the game except locker combinations, lever & slider puzzles, but it was okay for what the game provided. Uniqueness and mini games would come in later ND editions.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: The way the culprit was caught was rather odd and unsatisfactory. I was confused on what exactly happened and scoffed at the simple and unexplainable way I had to catch them. Perhaps some French punishment should have been introduced :) instead. The climax in the Royal Tower was spectacular on a visual level and again you had to pay close attention to Nancy's notes regarding what happened to everyone in the conclusion.  BTW: How is Nancy able to bounce around the castle in a good mood after being knocked unconscious hours earlier? Seems rather ridiculous to me.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me two days [7 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 82\n\nMy Strong Points: I guessed the culprit and have been on quite a run lately [14 correct out of 21 games]. I seemed to assimilate into the plot pretty well without being fooled into believing any side story that would skew my detective work. The puzzles were simple to complete and I noticed that similar puzzles were placed in later games.  I was able to deduce that I had to start the ski lift in order to be saved from the cold weather!\n\nMy Weak Points: A walkthrough was used only a couple times just to check my game flow because HER had a sloppy time integrating the \"incident trigger tree\" properly.  In layman's terms, I completed tasks a couple hours ahead due to my prowess only to find out later that the character was still wondering how to do the SAME events just accomplished by asking other people!\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 86 + 82/ 2 = 84 [ B ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I saw more written dialogue glitches [Bess [I believe] said \"someting\" instead of someTHING]. Overall, I learned only a bit more French history than I knew already, but for children, this is a fine starter education of European society.  I recommend it for that, but compared to the future games, it was rather simplistic.\n\nThus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, TREASURE ranks.... # 5 !!!!!\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5\n2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87\n3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5\n5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER  * 84\n6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 83\n7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5\n8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78\n11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77\n13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76\n14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72\n15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5\n16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71\n17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5\n18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70\n19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5\n20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69\n21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68</td><td>09 17, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>null</td><td>FRENCH DIAMOND OF A STORYLINE [YET ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES]</td><td>1410912000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I might be biased about this game because it was the first I ever played (and the first I ever finished -- since, when I started playing, I had all of the first five that I was flipping between, and six and seven came out very close on the heels of them, so I didn't actually finish any until a while after I'd received them).\n\nHowever, biases aside, this game still holds as my all-time favorite. I will admit it isn't the best game in the series, but that's ok by me. It isn't extremely difficult, but it isn't overly easy. The characters are all interesting (and this game introduces my favorite ND character, Professor Hotchkiss). I love history, and this game is full of that. But the best part about it? The exploring. I will admit that the movements are a little bit limited, but this is only the fourth game. They hadn't yet refined things. However, in this game, every time you progress (almost) you get to unlock a new area in the game. There are so many places to go in this little castle, so many things to see.  This game gave me so much to imagine, so much to think on, and, now that I'm older, it gives me a ton of inspiration.\n\nTo anyone that hasn't played this game, I highly recommend it. If you've played other games but not this one, I'm completely shocked. You need to play this game NOW. And if you're looking for an introduction to the series, look no further. Treasure in a Royal Tower is a wonderful classic that I really hope will enthrall you as much as it has me these last ten years.</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>null</td><td>My favorite Nancy Drew game.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>With certain recent games like WAC and SAW, it's evident that with each and every Nancy Drew PC release, the graphics and voice acting get better and better. But sometimes, no matter how good the graphics are, they usually can't hide an empty storyline and a game in need of many touch ups. This game is an example of a decent edition to the series, and even though it's not one of my favorites, it doesn't need \"makeup\" to make it shine.\n\nStory: 8.5/10. This game has a decent story that holds together pretty well. Much of the game centers around centuries old history, much of it on Marie Antoinette. Although you ended up learning a few things, the story was still very inticing and it wasn't like they were shoving all of the information down your throat.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 8/10. I'm not going to rate a lot of this game on graphics, mainly because the graphics of today are automatically compared to these graphics, and considering this game and the new games were released a decade apart, I think it's fair to somewhat disregard the graphics. I liked the setting, even though you stay in one place, and I like moving around more. But this castle was ginormous, and I had plenty of trouble just finding my room.\n\nCharacters: 8/10. The characters this time all have pretty stand-out personalities. You have Dexter Egan, the caretaker of the building, Professor Hotchkiss, a hilarious if not somewhat annoying author who can never get Nancy's name right, Lisa, a photojournalist, and Jacques Brunais, a french ski intructor. They all have a distinct personality, and are a great touch to the overall atmosphere.\n\nPuzzles: 7.5/10. They're weren't that many puzzles, but the ones that were there were hard, but they fit the game.\n\nExploration: 9/10. Exploring is a big part of this game, and I got lost a lot. The castle is so big, and there's plenty for you to explore and have an adventure in.\n\nActivities: 4/10. Activities weren't really evident in the older games, and they're weren't any here either.\n\nEnding: 6.5/10. The ending was somewhat not surprising, and a pretty simple one too, yet it still gave me the goosebumps that good Nancy Drew PC endings give me. You people know what I mean.\n\nTotal (averaged): 7.3 out of 10, rounded to....\n\n7.5/10.\n\nAs a diehard Nancy Drew PC fan, I did enjoy this game, and it deserves a spot on any fan's shelf.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>null</td><td>Treasure in the Royal Tower review.</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>With each passing Nancy Drew game, the games have gotten better. In the past three alone, they've gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.\n\nNancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...\n\nThis is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (\"fictional\" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little \"toned down\" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).\n\nLike the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.\n\nWhile the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.\n\nThe cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her \"theory\" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).\n\nLike the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.\n\nThe game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall \"castle\" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically \"royal\", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.\n\nWhile the previous game is a close runner-up, \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that it's still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\" and \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\". Between the rich sense of history, awesome casting, wonderfully detailed settings, and great soundtrack, this surely remains one of Nan's most memorable cases to date.

I'd seen really good reviews for this game, but I was still kind of apprehensive because it's such an old game, I thought the graphics would be really horrible. But I was surprised at what a quality game it is! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 4.5/5: Nancy's ski vacation is cut short when a blizzard keeps her stuck in the Wisconsin castle she's staying at. Apparently in the 1920's, some guy who really loved French castles decided to build one in Wisconsin, and even imported a tower from Marie Antoinette's castle to be added on to his. Nancy learns that Marie Antoinette was rumored to have left a treasure somewhere in the castle, so it's up to her to find the treasure before someone else tears the castle apart trying to find it. I thought this was a really good plot, and everything else into the story tied into it nicely. I only wish it had been longer, it was a little shorter than I had hoped. But overall, I was impressed!\n\nCHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The characters include the castle's caretaker, Dexter, who is very defensive and has a dark past, and Jacques, a famous French skier who was actually really fun to listen to. The hotel's guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so I'm going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.\n\nSETTING - 5/5: I loved the castle!! It was huge, I got lost plenty of times just trying to find my hotel room, haha. But there was tons to explore. Plus I was surprised how good the graphics were. I thought they might be kind of shabby because it's an older game, but I was way off. And the music was really nice, some of the best music I've heard in a Nancy Drew game.\n\nPUZZLES - 3/5: I felt there was a serious lack of puzzles in this game. Maybe this came out before Her Interactive got the idea of putting in \"filler puzzles\" to make the games longer. It was kind of nice not having to do a puzzle every second, but I do want to have SOME puzzles. There were probably less than a handfull of puzzles in the whole game, wich must have been why it was so short.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING?: No. Like I said before theres only a few puzzles, and everything else is pretty easy. I'd give it a 2 for challenge.\n\nENDING - 5/5: The ending was good. It made perfect sense with the rest of the plot. The culprit isn't a surprise, but catching them was fun.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 4.5\nCharacters: 3.5\nSetting: 5\nPuzzles: 3\nChallenge: 2\nEnding: 5\n= 23 divided by 6 = 3.8 rounded to 4.</td><td>09 19, 2010</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>null</td><td>A Classic ND Treasure</td><td>1284854400</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This was, personally, the first Nancy Drew game that I ever played, and because of it, I am now hooked on the series and buy each new one that comes out.  I am very happy that this was my first game, as it is not only, in my opinion, one of the best games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also the perfect mix of mystery and intrigue.\n\nStory-You are on a ski vacation in Wisconsin when you get snowed in at the castle/resort in which you are staying.  You find out that the castle library has been vandalized, and you set out to find out who destroyed the beautiful library and why.  As you make your way through the game, you will also find that the story has quite a bit to do with the history of Marie Antoinette.\n\nGraphics-The graphics are improved from the earlier three games, as the 3D backgrounds have a bit more detail.  Also, the characters have been developed to move a bit more smoothly.\n\nSound-The music in the game is very regal and pleasant to listen to.  The background sounds are also well done as they sound realistic.  As for the voice acting, this game has some actors/actresses that sound really good and interesting.\n\nGameplay-First of all, like the games before it in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  Although there is only one main location to explore (the castle) it is a very large location filled with many rooms to explore and many puzzles to solve.  The puzzles range from easy to hard, but they are all solvable without any need of a walkthrough.  The hint system is there for you, if you need it though, which basically consists of calling your friends on the phone to ask for a hint.  There are also four characters that you can interact with and interrogate, and they each have a unique and interesting personality.\n\nLength-This is definitely a game with some meat to it length-wise.  It will take you several hours to finish it, and hopefully, you will have fun with every second of it.\n\nIf you're looking for an intriguing adventure game with fun puzzles and a great story, then this is the perfect game for you!</td><td>12 12, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>null</td><td>A perfect game in the series</td><td>1260576000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005LVWL</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Imagine this: you're snowbound in a fancy Wiconsin hotel where you're supposed to be on a ski vacation.

Out of the four games I've played (\"Final Scene,\" \"Secrets Can Kill,\" \"Message in a Haunted Mansion, \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\"), \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore.\nNancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinette's name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.\nThe locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesn't want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy!\nBuyer Beware:\nI *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of \"Invalid CHUNK file.\" I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well. There is no patch available on HerInteractive's website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didn't go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldn't let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time.

It LOOKS a lot better than windows 2000 and other previous versions, and also it seems to load a lot faster than windows 2000. Which warrants my 2 star rating.\nThe new set up in Windows XP is very cumbersome and sometimes downright confusing.  For those of us that are familiar with Win 2K you will find that many things are not in places where we are used to them being.  This is a small problem and im sure that I will become comfortable with it.  My main gripe is the constant application lock ups in this OS for no apparant reason.  For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer, then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again.  Same goes true for Outlook.  Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out, or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows.  Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday.  Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason.  To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating \"sorry for the inconvience\" and an option to send the error report to microsoft. HA!  It looks like Microsoft expected this OS to have a lot of problems (and that it does) and are using the customers to find all their bugs for them.  I wouldn't mind doing this for a pay check, but for free?  I don't think so.\nI've only used XP for 4 days and already having a multitude of problems with constant lock ups and crashes.  I haven't had the oppurtunity to do software installations on this OS, and frankly I don't want to, im sure that is also littered with bugs.

When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.\nWindows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.\nThis is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.\nThe acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)\nI've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.\nAs with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.\nI will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:\n* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever\n* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start\n* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP\n* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically\n* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP\n* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.\n* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.\nAnd simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.\nIn terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.\nI think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.\nRecommended</td><td>01 21, 2003</td><td>A1YK56DPXS5DFX</td><td>Carlos Santiago</td><td>null</td><td>A solid operating system</td><td>1043107200</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00005MOTH</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>If you have Windows ME, you will want to upgrade (ME being one of the most annoying operating systems ever from Microsoft.)

I also run this on a laptop (Toshiba Satellite) and the power management feature for dimming the screen and managing the battery is welcome, as the Toshiba battery uptime is a bit limited.

Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is \"awesome\", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The \"start menu\", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the \"start menu\" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, \"ME\" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. \"KODAK\". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home.

In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.\nInstallation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.\nOnce installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a \"classic\" Windows 9x view.\nWindows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party \"usage tracking\" cookies that are placed on your PC.\nBackward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that \"DOS EMULATORS\" will be available for purchase in the near future.\nWindows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.\nFor those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.\nFor those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.\nThere is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself.

OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it.

Your sound card vendor may have stopped making software drivers a long time ago for your now discontinued device. The problem is that they do not want to spend the resources to create drivers for a product that they no longer make. So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly won't work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP. You might wind up spending close to the same amount of money upgrading your components to make it work, as you would to just simply buy a new one.

The \"start menu\", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the \"start menu\" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, \"ME\" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. \"KODAK\". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home. It all depends on the user and the environment, as simple as that.</td><td>01 19, 2002</td><td>A15S4XW3CRISZ5</td><td>Andre Da Costa</td><td>null</td><td>Windows XP Professional (Depends)</td><td>1011398400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005MOTG</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Perhaps I've become so jaded that all Windows systems now look the same.\nI'm ashamed to say just what was the first version of Windows I used but I will go on record stating that I have owned Windows 95, 98, ME and now XP.\nAs it is an Upgrade, I suppose that's why there is no significant difference once I get going.

I takes A L-O-N-G time to do the install (a single cd, yet prepare to spend about 2 hours once you hit \"go\").\nMOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER....\nIf you do nothing else to prepare for the upgrade; take the time to run the hardware & software compatibility check before you commit yourself to the install.  This is most critical & here's a good example.  The driver for my PC's modem/chipset was incompatible with XP.  This was highlighted when I ran the test and it allowed me to retrieve the updated driver before launching the upgrade.  If I had not done this, then I would have been toast.  After the upgrade I would not have been able to use my modem to access the internet to get the new driver after the fact.  So do yourself a favor, run the test, print it out, get all your patches beforehand & you'll save yourself a ton of frustration and wasted time.\nOther than that it's great and very easy to load.

If you're thinking about using this upgrade version, let me warn you of two things:  (1) You need to check all of your software to see if it's compatible with XP (there is a checking-program on this disc, but you can also download it from Microsoft's website to see which software you have is not compatible).  Even after I checked compatibility, some programs I had were non-functioning after the upgrade and some I had to install again.  (2) Download the most recent drivers for all your hardware to avoid problems.  I didn't do this and when I upgraded, I lost my sound card drivers because they weren't compatible with XP and the XP disc didn't have the new drivers I needed to make my sound card work, so I had to find my sound card manufacturer's website and download an XP compatible driver.\nYou are really better off waiting until you buy a new computer to get XP.  But, if you just can't wait and want to do this upgrade, make sure you do your homework to avoid some headaches during and after installation.

The new \"BSOD\", or blue screen of death, is now more of a \"grey hiccup of aggravation\".  After a crash, a little grey box pops up and says \"you have chosen to end a non-responsive program.  Would you like to send an error report to MS?\"  I must see this box 2-3 times a day, no kidding.  When it really has a processor brain-freeze, it just completely reboots, w/o warning.  These things are a normal occurrence for me. This is on a clean install, up-to-date system.  I've seen it with other systems as well.  Many of my friends hate XP for this reason, but I've learned to live with it, just as I did with all its predecessors.  Other than that, I really like a lot of the other features, and pretty much all the new toys and MS add-ins are XP-only, so it's worth the upgrade, (if nothing else), to avoid becoming obsolete.  It just gets my goat that many people are constantly touting how stable it is, and I routinely see otherwise.

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.\nThe Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the \"old computer,\" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).\nInstallation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.\nUsing XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the \"clear type\" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a \"normal\" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).\nI'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).

You will be amazed on how many third party \"usage tracking\" cookies that are placed on your PC.\nBackward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didn't work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that \"DOS EMULATORS\" will be available for purchase in the near future.\nWindows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.\nFor those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.\nFor those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.\nThere is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.</td><td>10 29, 2001</td><td>A3H4TIVTTA5IBB</td><td>Brian A.

Because when people used to have computer problems with Windows 95,98, and ME, I was always first on everyone's list to come fix their computer problems.  It was fun at first, but then I was really sick of it.  When XP came out, I recommended to all those people to get XP.  Now, NO ONE has called me since with a computer problem.  That shows you how wonderful this operating system is.  XP is not perfect; but it works well enough to keep the average computer user happy with the condition of their computer. It is virtually idiot proof and it is very difficult to 'mess it up'.  The system restore function is a big plus.  Also, Windows XP keeps your system files from being corrupted by viruses by not allowing unauthorized access to the files.  I'm not saying that it's virus-proof, but much more secure than previous Windows versions.  The only downside to XP is that some computer games don't seem to work good with it unless they were made compatible with XP.</td><td>06 12, 2003</td><td>AVYMBTCXYREXE</td><td>Batmanbrb</td><td>null</td><td>The Best of Microsoft's Operating Systems To Date...</td><td>1055376000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005MOTF</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Microsoft finally got it right with Windows XP (Home Edition).  Based upon the highly reliable Windows NT, XP is a stable, reliable, and thoroughly functional operating system that cures most of the flaws that earlier versions of Windows are known for.\nFirst and foremost, the \"Blue Screen of Death\" is gone!  I run XP on three computers in my home via a home network, and I have literally never seen the dreaded Blue Screen.  While both Windows 98 (which I thought was a pretty good OS) and Windows ME (horrible!!!) require frequent re-booting, XP does not.  You can go weeks, even months, without rebooting XP.  It is stable and reliable.\nSpeaking of home networks, XP Home Edition does a very good job if you want to set up a peer-to-peer network in your home.  We run one notebook (via a wireless connection base station hub) and two desktops via XP, and you can literally set something like this up in less than an hour, counting hardware hookups.  The Networking Wizard actually works, and takes almost all of the pain out of setting up a network.  If you want a peer-to-peer home network, XP is for you.\nOne warning--XP does not support a domain (server) network.  If you are interested in this sort of configuration you want Windows Professional Edition.  You cannot use XP for this.\nWindows XP is well-supported as regards various peripheral devices.  When I upgraded, I had no difficulty downloading the necessary drivers for my three printers, one scanner, and various other devices.  Most worked OK out of the box, but upgraded drivers are available from most vendors via the internet.\nSpeaking of the Internet, XP is truly dependent upon the Internet, and I would imagine that a user without Internet access would find XP very difficult to use.  XP is among the new generation of software of which Internet access is an integral design assumption.  The OS uses the Internet to register itself, obtain updates, and obtain drivers.  This is reflective of a trend whereby in my opinion every computer installation will in a very real way have as its centerpiece the Internet connection of the user.  Dial-up's days are numbered too--XP files, like most files nowadays, are simply too large for a 56K dial-up modem.\nIn my opinion Microsoft hit a home run with Windows XP, almost enough to cause me to forgive them for Windows ME, which was absolutely awful.  If you are using ME, RUN, don't walk, to upgrade.</td><td>06 4, 2003</td><td>A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</td><td>Roger J.

I've also used an OS 9 and 10 Mac.  None of them matches Windows XP.  It is simply the best, hands down.  I even like it better for using Photoshop and Illustrator than a Mac and that statement is virtually heresy in the art world! First, it is not buggy and not crash prone.  It reliably works all of the time.  Windows 2000 was very good in that regard and XP is even better. 95 and 98 were terrible regarding crashes and reliability. I'm also using Windows Media Player 9 with it, which is a terrific player, and I'm even able to use all wma files (1/3 the size) rather than mp3 after using a converter. I stopped using Real Player after getting on this Player 9, which works the best with XP.  Second, if I need help on something on my computer, I can have my friend in a different city, also on XP, take over my controls using the Net Meeting feature.  He was able to reinstall a program for me that was giving me fits.  Third, there are loads of special programs that work especially in conjunction with XP that further enhance it, such as Firegraphic 5 where you can see all your images and view them in filmstrips, slide shows and big versions. And that's just one of many special programs that I've used on XP.  It is also a delight to go to any website and find that whatever you can download there is compatible with XP.  One thing that would really turn me off a Mac, by contrast, is the notice on many programs or features on the web that they haven't developed a version yet for a Mac.  I also like the way Windows Explorer works in XP and that it looks better than in any earlier version of Windows.  As my giant file cabinet, it is very easy for me to keep everything organized in WE and the thumbnails of my jpgs, tifs, ais, htms and so forth are terrific.  The task bar is much improved from 2000 and I found I could even get rid of my pop up remover program because XP makes it so easy to close multiple browser windows with one right click on the task bar on a grouped browser window button. I also get beautiful thumbnails now when I use right click.  There is a wonderful XP magazine that comes from the UK (called simply Windows XP) that I would love to see Amazon have available for subscription.

What is with those cinnabar handprints and why is she in another mystery!?? Can't a girl catch a break?\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 83\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nJoanna Riggs: The original curator of the museum that is hanging on to her job after indiscriminate past dealings with finding rare artifacts.  She is hard-nosed with things running correctly and I found her type pretty typical in this career position.  I don't feel she is as moral as she wants to seem, but since she isn't bothering me, I overlook that for the most part.  I never considered her a culprit.\n\nHenrik van der Hune: A epigrapher that took a tumble on the indoor temple steps. I had to help restore his memory and always felt he was both a straight-laced boring personality to an outright professional in his career.  I never thought he could be the culprit.\n\nTaylor Sinclair: An art dealer in close connection with Johanna. This is the epitome of the sleazy criminal look with the thin mustache, shallow chin, and greasy hair. I didn't know if HER was putting up a facade with an obvious guilty caricature so I was 50/50 in my decision.\n\nAlejandro del Rio:  The U.S. ambassador to the mexican  consulate; he seems firm on righting wrongs that have taken precious artifacts out of the hands of his home country. He was my top option as the culprit because he seemed too handsome and proper somehow for the anger that could be felt beneath his demeanor.\n\nBESS/GEORGE/HARDY BOYS PHONE CONTACTS:  The girls were entertaining as always, but there was only so much they could actually help me with; same for the boys but on an even lesser level.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 82\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\n\nThe music was pretty uptempo and brought one into the mysteries of the Mayan culture.  Graphics were pristine for that early game design period.  Out in the museum garden, those bird noises were pretty unique. Was that a crested Guan?\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 84\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The three levels of the Mayan temple reserved for fill-in answer quizzes, basket hoop throwing, and the BUL game, kept my interest for the time being, but they were't challenges that you would describe as overly fascinating. The audio translation match was intriguing because it also helped you learn about the Mayans throughout the entirety of the museum which gave this particular adventure more of a \"learning series\" edge.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 85\n\nGENERAL IOTAS: I wouldn't call that corpse in the monolith a mummy [aren't those properly prepared?].  Why was a missing part of the escape challenge in the Whisperer's mouth? Doesn't make sense.  Also, why was the culprit using that scarlet hand imprint? I never got any explanation of why that was significant.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: I read too much into how tricky HER might be in this adventure, but it turned out \"not that much\". Why were all three of the innocent characters awaiting me as I exited the monolith? That was a weird situation in which I would want some answers on how this came to be.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days [12 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 62\n\nMy Strong Points: My memory was pretty impressive by memorizing the facts of Mayan culture meant for the quizzes and my adeptness at puzzling the pottery and key parts together was there.\n\nMy Weak Points: To save on time, I used a walkthrough only to bridge me from one part of the plot to another without delay. Um, I used this a LOT.\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 62/ 2 = 73 [ C - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I was pretty bored I must admit, but not because the game was poorly designed. I think that anything that has a setting being museum-focused is bound to make me stare out the window wanting for better days.  This comes in at average overall entertainment with very interesting highlights towards the end.\n\nThus far, on my list of the 26 completed ND games, SCARLET ranks.... # 16 !!!!!\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 90\n2) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 87\n3) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 86\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.5\n5) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 83.5\n6) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER  * 82.5\n7) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 82\n8) SECRET OF OLD CLOCK  * 81.5\n9) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY  * 80\n11) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 79.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 78\n13) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE  * 77.5\n14) LEGEND OF CRYSTAL SKULL  * 77\n15) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 75.5\n16) SECRET OF SCARLET HAND  * 73\n17) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 72.5\n18) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 72\n19) THE SILENT SPY  * 71.5\n20) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 71\n21) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 70.5\n22) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 70\n23) LABYRINTH OF LIES  * 69.5\n24) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 69\n25) RANSOM SEVEN SHIPS  * 68.5\n26) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 66.5</td><td>11 21, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>null</td><td>YOU CAUGHT ME RED-HANDED!

I don't know why, but I always just assumed that I wouldn't like this game. Maybe it's because it's notoriously educational (and who wants a game that is like school?) or maybe it's because the previews for it aren't terribly interesting. Whatever the case, Nancy Drew has once again proved me wrong. My intuition on these games must be seriously off, because every game I'm sure I won't like ends up being one of my favorites. And this has indeed become one of my favorites of the early Nancy Drew titles. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy is hired as the Deputy Curator at a Washington, DC museum called Beech Hill. It is quite an exciting time for Beech Hill because they are preparing to open a new exhibit on the Maya, the highlight of which will be a very rare (and very expensive) artifact - a large elaborately carved stone called a monolith.\n\nBut poor Nancy just has the worst luck when it comes to vacations and dream jobs. Before she knows it, Beech Hill is robbed of one of its most beloved artifacts; a rare and unusual jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal. It seems to be related to a string of art thefts happening across the country, since in all the incidents Mayan jade artifacts were the target and a threatening red handprint was left at the scene.\n\nI thought this plot was just wonderful. It was well thought out, thorough, and unique among other ND titles. The length was perfect; I finished it over the course of a few days. There were lots of little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. It was interesting and intriguing, and very educational. Let me repeat that; it was VERY educational. It is set in a museum, after all. There is tons of information to take in - some of which is vital to the mystery of some of which is not. I have always loved history and am especially interested in the Maya and Aztec so this game was just my cup of tea. But if you don't like history - or aren't a big fan of plenty of reading in a ND game - this game might not be for you.\n\nCHARACTERS - 4/5: Suspects in this game include Joanna Riggs, the curator of Beech Hill and therefore Nancy's boss, a fairly serious young woman with a history of being a bit too eager to acquire artifacts for the museum. Henrik van der Hune is the museum's resident expert in translating Mayan glyphs, so he is arguably the only person in the museum who can guess an artifact's true value. Then there is Taylor Sinclair, an art dealer located in DC, who often does business with Joanna and appears to be unusually concerned over the museum's safety. Finally, there is Alejandro del Rio, a Mexican ambassador who accuses Beech Hill and other museums like it of flat-out stealing artifacts that rightfully belong to Mexico.\n\nPhone friends include Bess and George, the Hardy Boys, and Franklin Rose, who is a member of the Beech Hill board of directors and friend of Nancy's father. There are quite a few one or two time phone friends related to the plot as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the four suspects weren't very memorable. Their personalities were not particularly well defined and there wasn't anything quirky or fun about them. Worst of all, none of them were very suspicious. Basically, no one from this cast of characters is going to be making my favorites list anytime soon. However, the previous deputy curator, Sonny Joon, seen only in notebooks he left behind at the museum, was absolutely hilarious and his notebooks were a delightful comic relief. I hear he shows up again in some of the newer titles so I'm really looking forward to that.\n\nSETTING - 5/5: The setting was excellent. Beech Hill was very interesting and there was tons to look at inside. If it were a real museum I would definitely visit. Other places to see include Nancy's hotel room, Taylor's office, Alejandro's office, as well as some other locations that are unlocked throughout the course of the game. One thing that really blew me away was how realistic it all was. There were little things - like how could you see the exterior of every building before you entered it - that made a huge difference. It was so easy to get into the mystery because it really felt like I was there.\n\nPUZZLES - 4.5/5: I liked the puzzles, though this game tended to repeat itself as far as puzzles go. In other words, you do the same thing a few times throughout the game. The puzzles in the museum were mostly information scavenger hunts, where Nancy would be posed with a quiz question and you would have to search the museum exhibits for the answer. That didn't bother me, but I could easily understand someone finding it tedious and too slow-paced. In hindsight this game wasn't as puzzle-heavy as some other ND titles, which worked for me as I'm not a huge puzzle fan. But the puzzles did work in seamlessly with the plot and I never felt like I was stuck doing something unnecessary just to make the game longer.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING? Not really. Most - if not all - of the puzzles are explained by the game, and Nancy can call her friends for hints. I did go online for help once for a game of \"chance\" that I lost maybe 20 times in a row, thinking that there might be some strategy I was missing. But it seems that the mini-game couldn't be won until you reached a certain point in the plot, which frankly was pretty frustrating to learn I had wasted all that time. Anyways, I would give it a 3 for challenge.\n\nENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was probably the only part of this game that really didn't impress me. Although the ending was very intense, it was just sort of awkward and didn't make a whole lot of sense. The culprit wasn't too predictable and their motive made sense. Overall the ending was underwhelming. But be warned that the ending of this game is pretty creepy, and because of it I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for young children.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 4\nSetting: 5\nPuzzles: 4.5\nChallenge: 3\nEnding: 3.5\n= 25, divided by 6 = 4.16 rounded to 4 stars</td><td>07 7, 2013</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>null</td><td>History Buffs Rejoice!</td><td>1373155200</td><td>true</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is one of their learning heavy games, and I really appreciate that. It still manages to be extremely adventurous even though you're in the downtown of a big city rather than out in a castle, or a haunted mansion. The knowledge gained in this game is interesting, which is what makes the learning worth while. Just make sure you actually have a notebook sitting out to take notes.\n\nMy favorite part of this game is it's ending. It's hinted at a little bit, but when I first played through this game I never would have guessed at what would happen. As a kid, this ending scared me worse than the Ghost Dogs (of Moon Lake) ever could (I should mention that I got into these games just before this and Ghost Dogs was released, and Message in a Haunted Mansion didn't scare me because I -correctly- guessed at what was going on rather early, since I'd seen it so often before on Scooby Doo).\n\nI mark it as my fourth favorite (1. Treasure, 2. Blackmoor, 3. Shadow at Water's Edge, 4. this one, 5. Danger on Deception Island) and I understand why some people might get frustrated and want to put it down. But, unlike many of the games between 11 and 23, at least it doesn't leave people saying 'that's it?' at the end of it.</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>null</td><td>One of my top five favorite games.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>Sometimes when I find myself critiquing Nancy Drew games, I realize how much variety this series has, while still never really moving it's roots; The sleuthing that we all love has relatively stayed the same, but the setting changes with every game. Whether it's a haunted mansion, or a ranch or even a train, HERInteractive takes on a new form of fun with each additional mystery, and while Secret of the Scarlet Hand is an older game in the series, and definitely not one of my favorites, there is still fun to be had with it, and orginiality is clearly evident.\n\nStory: 6.5/10. Nancy lands an internship at a museum in Washington D.C, which is devoted to the Mayan culture and will soon be exhibiting a newly discovered monolith to the public. But, shortly before the exhibition, one of the museum's most treasured pieces is stolen from the museum, as well as a strange 'accident' that occurs involving the museum's epigrapher. It definitely wasn't one of my favorite plots, but was still somewhat interesting.\n\nSetting: 6.5/10. It was definitely an interestingly original idea to have a Nancy Drew game take place in a museum specializing in Mayan culture. You also get to hope on a subway to visit other character's offices, a hospital and Nancy's hotel room. I personally thought that the museum was pretty boring, but maybe less boring as the game progressed, and I found things I didn't know were there before.\n\nCharacters: 6/10. The characters were pretty annoying this time around. The epigrapher who got amnesia was very irritating to care to and talk to, Taylor Sinclair, an art specialist, was very annoying, and Alejandro, an ambassador to the Mexican Consolate, was even more annoying to talk to.\n\nPuzzles: 8.5/10. The puzzles were good this time around, and the only reason I'm saying this is that there's a pyramid inside the museum, and on each level on this part of the museum, there are different quizzes and games that you have to complete to progress to the next floor. This was a big part of the game and I LOVED it.\n\nActivities: 6/10. There weren't that many activities, but the games in the pyrmaid were decent.\n\nEnding: 6.5/10. The ending was obvious, and what you had to do to end the game was kind of confusing, and took me a few tries to get it right.\n\nTotal (averaged): 6.6 out of 10, averaged to....\n\n6.5/10.\n\nAlthough this game does have some originality and fun, it's too bland and boring for my taste, and I'd recommend new HERInteractive fans to go with another purchase for now.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>null</td><td>Secret of the Scarlet Hand review</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is here! The follow-up of \"The Final Scene\" continues to offer some great gaming with complex puzzles, intense plots, and some cool characters. While I prefer the previous three games, \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is a good game, and among the most important games in the series.\n\nNancy has decided to take a break and head out for an internship at Beech Hill Museum in Washington, D.C. Her dad's friend, Franklin Rose, has spoken with the Board of Directors to set this up for her, and she'll be working with several other experts of Mayan culture to set up Beech Hill's new exhibit, featuring a jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal and ancient monolith that was recently excavated from Mexico. While Nancy's internship starts off peaceful, Beech Hill soon becomes victim of a burglary! After the theft, Nancy finds a piece of paper with a gruesome scarlet hand left in the place of the now-missing Pacal carving. While investigating, she learns that a series of similar thefts have occurred around the country. Nancy's now determined to retrieve the carving and catch this thief red-handed.\n\nThe setting was great, and unlike any that's been seen in a Nancy Drew game before (or since). While there is more limited exploration, the areas that were able to be explored were nicely decorated and fully-interactive. I liked walking through the temple of Maya games and playing them all, as well as exploring other areas in Washington D.C. The abundant exploration that was in the previous three installments is definitely lacking here, though. There were several locations that didn't serve much of a purpose in the game (save to talk with a specific suspect) and the museum lacked any secret passageways. Regardless, the places that the suspects are conversed with are very nicely detailed and I rather enjoyed seeing different areas and buildings in Washington, D.C. while living vicariously through Nancy.\n\nSome of the chores were rather tedious, such as matching up an exhibit with its correct recording. However, chores like these were the exception instead of the rule. Most of the games were rather entertaining, especially the maze and ancient Mayan games.\n\nThe suspects are probably the most disappointing aspect in this game. They include the museum curator, Joanna Riggs, Henrik Van Der Hume, the artifact expert, Alejandro del Rio, the attach to the Mexican Consulate, and Taylor Sinclair, the art dealer who helped Joanna get her hands on several of the artifacts that will soon be put on display. As a whole, the suspects are rather flat and unable to be conversed with much. Joanna is especially guilty of this, as her character definitely borders on useless. Most questions Nancy asks her, she answers with something along the lines of \"Henrik can help you with that.\" Taylor and Alejandro are hardly much better when it comes to development, only serving to be conversed with once every so often and not providing much insight into the case. On the contrary, Henrik was awesome and nicely developed, and he winds up playing a very large role in the game itself.\n\nWhile three of the four suspects weren't very developed, they all did have some great motives to be the culprit in the end. Even though I didn't see this culprit coming when I first played the game, I see in hindsight that he/she is truly the most logical choice. This is definitely another game in which I cannot see anybody but the guilty party as the culprit in the end.\n\nAs stated before, the suspects weren't very nicely integrated. The phone friends, on the other hand, were very well scripted and employed. I loved all of the conversations that Nancy has on the phone with people, as they were humorously and cleverly composed. Most importantly, several characters that play important roles in the Nancy Drew series as a whole make their first appearance in this game, including Frank and Joe Hardy (AKA The Hardy Boys), Poppy Dada, Prudence Rutherford, and Sonny Joon. This is also the first game to feature the name of the Krolmeister company, which will play a substantial role in the games to come.\n\nThe music was definitely different when compared to other games, in that it has more of a \"historical\" and \"nature\" feel to it, while the soundtracks of other games were more \"mysterious\" and \"elegant\". This, however, is a bonus for this game. While previous games have focused on bandits, royalty, and magicians, this game focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization. The soundtrack was great for a museum filled with the histories of these ancient people, and all the tracks certainly felt in place.\n\nIs \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" my favorite Nancy Drew game of all time? No. Does it rank high on the list, though? Most definitely. While I did prefer the previous three games, this one certainly holds up to the high standards that the Nancy Drew series has set for itself. The plot is wonderful, and ultimately leads to an unforgettable and heart-pounding encounter that I never saw coming. Certainly can't wait to write about the next game all because of this one! :)</td><td>06 24, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>null</td><td>A Scarlet Secret Worth Discovering</td><td>1308873600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is one of my favorites in the series, but when playing this game I often found that they tried force too much history on you.  Other than that it's a great game, and I have the following comments on it:\n\nStory-You have a summer internship working at a Mayan museum in Washington D.C.  For those of you who don't know, the Mayan civilization was an Indian civilization that vanished without a trace.  Anyway, you are doing basic chores when a certain artifact is stolen, and a scarlet hand print is left at the scene of the crime.  Hence the title.  Eventually, you solve this mystery only to have another one thrown at you in the middle of the game, so you are actually getting 2 stories in 1.\n\nGraphics-These are pretty good graphics, with the backgrounds looking pretty real.  The characters still look definitely fake, but this has pretty good graphics still.\n\nSound-The music is okay with kind of a Mayan twist on it, but the voice acting really isn't that great.  And the lips are REALLY off.  I ignore it, and it doesn't bother me, but others it might bother a little bit.\n\nGameplay-The gameplay is exactly the same as the others in the series.  It is first person point-and-click.  You ride a metro system to get places, and the alarm clock is back, allowing you to go to sleep and wake up anytime you want.  The puzzles in this game are a little more difficult and numerous than in other games, and some of them are quite boring, but most are fun, and I can forgive the ones that aren't.\n\nFun-This game is pretty fun, but unlike the other games where there is just a tad bit of learning mixed in among the mystery, in this game, prepare to learn a LOT about Mayan history.  I hated it, because I hate history, but my friend loved it because he likes history.  I think the producers were just trying to appeal to history lovers as well as mystery lovers in this game, and I understand that.  No bad enough to give 3 stars, but not good enough for 5.\n\nLength-Oh.  My.  Goodness.  This is a rather long game.  It took me several months to finish, and whenever I replay it (which is a lot) it will take me about 12-15 hours because I still have trouble with some of the puzzles!\n\nThe puzzles are hard, but the answers are in the game, you just have to look for them.  The history is boring, but the story is great!  A great addition for history buffs, but if you don't like history, this game is still worth playing through at least once!</td><td>12 13, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>null</td><td>There is a large focus on Mayan history in this game</td><td>1260662400</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have played all the Nancy Drew titles from Her Interactive, and Secret of the Scarlet Hand (based on Nancy Drew book 125) is the best (and most impressive) of the lot. In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.\nFirst, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.\n\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.\nThis is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. \"Scarlet Hand\" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and \"Scarlet Hand\" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.</td><td>07 10, 2003</td><td>A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</td><td>Bundt Lust</td><td>null</td><td>&iexcl;Bienvenido al mundo de los maya!</td><td>1057795200</td><td>false</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>B000066ST3</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is the 6th in this series by HER Interactive. Each game is full of clues, puzzles, and exciting (and possibly dangerous) adventures. \"Scarlet Hand\" is no exception. In this game, you (as Nancy) take an internship at the Beech Hill Museum, and when a priceless artifact goes missing, it's up to you to find out what's going on. You'll explore the museum (which includes a pyramid with several levels, and an outside exhibit), and take the subway to visit several other key locations. You'll talk to various people, all the while knowing that one of them could be the thief. It's a really fun game; I've played all the others and this one took longer than the previous game (\"Final Scene\") for me. It took about 10 hours on the senior level, and I was playing it with a partner. There are a lot of facts to write down and recall, and the puzzles in this game are very original. I was very pleased with the number of puzzles; just the right amount. What I really liked about this game, in comparison to some of the other Nancy Drew games, was that you didn't have to maneuver your mouse so much to find things. In some of the other games, you can only see objects if you position your cursor at just the right angle turning just the right direction. In this game, everything was very out in the open and the game was easy to maneuver; surprisingly, however, that didn't make the game any less challenging than its predecessors. Just another great addition to the \"Nancy Drew\" games collection, \"Scarlet Hand\" is sure to please gamers and mystery-lovers alike.</td><td>09 15, 2002</td><td>A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2</td><td>Molly P.</td><td>null</td><td>Another great game!</td><td>1032048000</td><td>false</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>B000069IL2</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>That's right, the free bill pay offer via MSN is worth more than the price of the software alone.

Secondly, Money 2003 didn't remove key functionality that its predecessors sometime did -- so if you use an older version of Money, the features you like are still there.  Thirdly, you can batch epayments together and send them all at once (conversely, Money 2002 sent a payment by piecemeal, which was extremely slow and frustrating).  Fourthly, a good product has been tweaked to iron-out some of the frustrations of earlier versions.  In all -- it's a nice piece of software.\nWhat I don't like:  So far, I like everything I've seen.  If there is something you don't like about Money, in all likelihood, there is an Options setting that will correct the problem.  For example, to remove \"sponsor\" ads from within Money, find the option setting to stop displaying all sponsor's ads (by default, they'll show up).  Also, when upgrading from an earlier version of Money, the newly-installed Money 2003 installation isn't smart enough to know that you already have a Money file that you want to just pick-up and use.

Does that make the cockroach a superior being? (Well, the immunity to radiation bit is in their favor.)\nJaguar is the latest release of OS X. A true multitasking operating system based on UNIX. Yes, there is a REAL version of UNIX under the hood and the hackers among you will drool over the possibilities. Apple is beginning to take advantage of the superior hardware design capabilities of the Mac with OS X.\nThe best part, OS X hides the UNIX underpinnings in a superior Graphical User Interface (known as Aqua.) So, if you know nothing about UNIX, don't worry, you don't have to know UNIX to use a Mac. Ease of use has been the hallmark of Macs since their introduction back in 1984.\nYou have the ability to create a true multi-user enviornment. Multiple userids, multiple processes running simultaneously and protected memory. This means if you have a program crash, only the one program will crash, everything else keeps going and going and going. (Sorry Energizer Bunny, I couldn't resist.)\nIf you are a UNIX lover, Apple provides the Terminal application which gives you full access to the UNIX kernel system.\nIf you are among the long-time Mac user community, you may have come to love the capabilities of OS 9 (or 8 or earlier.) Some Macs still have the ability to boot into either OS 9 or OS X. Newer Macs only allow OS X booting. If you still have programs from the days when you could boot into OS 9, you can still run many of them in \"Classic\" environment. Classic is an emulator, running on OS X to allow you to still run older programs requiring the older OS. Admittedly, there are programs that won't work in Classic. Mostly programs needing custom-made extensions or Control Panels may not load. Also, most of the still-existing software companies are creating native OS X versions of their programs.\nIf you insist on running Windows XP or 2000 or 98 or 95 or DOS, you even have the option of running Virtual PC (which, by the way, is now owned by Microsoft - think about that for a moment.)\nThere is also a Mac version of Microsoft's Office Suite. This allows you to exchange documents with your PC counterparts, seamlessly.\nMacs have superior video capabilities and OS X takes full advantage of this.\nOS X has some superior software to go along for the ride - iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto and iTunes, to name a few. These are all free.\nWith OS X, Mac users will be leaving others in the dust.\nSuperior hardware design coupled with well-thought-out software design makes the Mac environment hard to beat.

Why, you might ask, would Mac users pay to play with a not-yet-ready for primetime OS?  I suppose you should ask Windows users the same question.

NIS warns you when something is accessing the internet, an excellent feature especially if you are always connected with a broadband service.  It also alerts you if there is a potential attack on your computer and automatically blocks the attack.

Also, you can tell Norton about important information you may keep on your computer, such as credit card numbers and account information, that you want Norton to protect and not allow to be sent out.

WRQ's AtGuard was a model of simplicity.\nIt threw a popup box whenever it encountered an event it didn't\nhave a rule to match.  Let's say incoming traffic fell through\nall your rules: AtGuard asks \"What should I do?  Allow it\nall the time, just this once, block it once, or block it all\nthe time?\"  Four choice, covers the gamut.  In the cases of\nads, that's enough.  In the cases of TCPIP or ICMP traffic,\npermanent choices also brings you right into a quick dialog\nof exactly what to block (port, address) and how to name it\n(blocking 427 incoming, blocking ms-sql-m traffic).\nFor NIS, especially the NIS2k series, you don't have these\nadvanced choices.  You also have a great deal of \"preset\"\nrules that aren't always useful, because they err on the side\nof blocking rather than permitting.  Good for newbies, not\ngood for pros.\nAnother downside if you're experienced is that to get to rule\neditors and advanced options, you have to click through an\nenormous cascade of menus.  In AtGuard, it's two clicks away.\nThat's just unacceptable: if the purpose is to keep newbies\nout of the advanced menus, just add a password and unlock\nthe necessary menus.\nFinally, NIS2k does away with site-specific ad filtering.\nInexplicably, you have to choose to block images from an entire\ndomain instead of a single machine.  For anyone who surfs Yahoo,\nyou understand the value of allowing us.yimg.com and\nnot us.a1.yimg.com.\nIn terms of how NIS2k works with systems, I strongly\ndeter individuals from using it.

The Spam Alert function is not quite perfect at distinguishing between true spam and valid messages, but it is a feature of at least some utility, and I am happy to see Symantec trying to incorporate it into their already excellent software package.

Last and certainly not least, this software allows you to block a great number of those increasingly annoying pop-up ads proliferating online.\nIf this is your first time using the firewall software, you will have to go through some important steps in order to configure your security system for your own needs, but the system walks you through this pretty well, meaning you don't need to be a computer expert to do it.  You will also have to specify any personal information (such as credit card numbers) you want to protect from accidental release via web forms and the like, but this is not hard to do.

Peter Norton, where are you?\nNSW 2003 continues the tradition of bloatware (lots of files and components, many surreptitiously loaded into your system at runtime even if you don't want them), dangerware (my Windows 2000 laptop went kaput after running WinDoctor and I had to reformat the hard drive), and ripping off the loyal customer (no upgrades from previous versions, as Richard Clayton clearly noted).\nIf you run Windows 2000 and esp. XP, you already have all the tools to help you diagnose your system and keep it running (except anti-virus).  In fact those tools, while not as fancy-looking as NSW, does a much better job and are infinitely more stable.  Also, your PC vendor might have given you other free tools like an anti-virus program, which is probably just as good as NAV.  If you have Windows 98 or earlier, NSW will very likely crash your system rather than keeping it error-free.

Oh my this is going to be exciting!  I was looking forward to some beautiful nature scenery and I wasn't disappointed. Moon Lake and the general lay of the lands [cemetary, speakeasy, sprawling trees] captured my imagination immediately.  The story of Prohibition law-breaking and rum-running really caught my attentions and found myself absorbed in the newspaper clippings and the desire to find the gold bars. This plot line was one of the Top Ten stories HER had to offer us players thus far!\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 93\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nRed Knott: This weird bird watcher that observes avian only at night gave me the creeps as I thought I caught sexual innuendos when I talked with him in that treehouse. \" If I do this this for you, what are you going to do for me? [long pause] and \"Pretty girls should be okay out here\" [something along those lines].  I immediately went into \"stranger-danger\" mode and kept to the cabin when he was around. And he ALWAYS was!\n\nEmily Griffen: Her twangy voice was peculiar and I had her pegged as my # 1 suspect I think mostly because I felt force-fed information about the other two residents and didn't want to buy too much into these evidential setups.\n\nJeff Akers: The park ranger with the big aspirations and familial ties to the mob had all the makings of a culprit served on a platter. He had motives to get the land back into public hands, rumors of hidden gold, etc.  I loved reading all the information in the ranger station which could be opposed by many of the young gamers who \"don't want to be educated like they were in school\" ha, ha.\n\nVivian Burnett Whitmore: She has to be on my Top Ten list of ND characters based on how funny it was talking with her and the information she provided me [relationship with the gangster Mickey Malone, the four rottweilers] and the key she mailed over.\n\nBeth/George/Hardy Boys: Again, didn't care for the Hint System, but I know I always had a place to call for a good laugh [my girls!] Dialing the phone feature was VERY tedious!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 93\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nBased on how I used to enjoy the woods in my youth, the visuals was absolutely perfect; especially the moonlight sequences!  The speakeasy was lovely, but there really wasn't much to do except examine paintings and I was frankly disappointed. The thuggy jazzy score set up with stirring moody numbers brought my mind back to the roaring 20's.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 3 = 96\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  Now that I think about it, I don't think there were ANY mini-games. I know the puzzles revolved mostly on collecting items [bird pictures & critters] and staying focused on the makeup of the dogs colored collars and such.  Not  bad in any sense, but when you compare that to other ND games, those captured your attention more. In this game it was a slight let-down.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 95\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: I got to see the evidence into making the actual \"ghost dogs\" and loved the cuteness of these canines [although wanted to release them from their cage].  I guessed the culprit!!!! That makes my rating about 45%  All-in-all, I was pretty pleased.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 95\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me two days [8 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 82\n\nMy Strong Points: I pushed through at a pretty rapid pace and never really got into any entanglements from puzzles or stuck in plot line devices. The water valve puzzle was solved with my screwdriver ingenuity and the tunnel navigation was nearly flawless.\n\nMy Weak Points: I guess I missed it when Vivian said Waldo's other name, because this puzzle kept me grounded in thought needlessly. I died on the rotten floorboards, ha, ha\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 94 + 82/ 2 = 88.5 [ B + ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I agree with other gamers that the ghost dogs were underutilized. The fact why I don't consider it a problem was that this wasn't a horror movie, this was an adventure.  I was quite occupied with the engaging storyline and not worried that I was going to by chased through the forests with my life at stake. Although missing the A grade HER so often does, it is one of their top adventures in the series thus far.\n\nThus far, on my list of the 19 completed ND games, GHOST DOGS ranks.... # 1 !!!!!\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5\n2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 87.5\n3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 87\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.5\n5) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 84\n6) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 82\n7) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND  * 81\n8) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE  * 78\n9) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY  * 77.5\n10) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 77\n11) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 76.5\n12) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 72\n13) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 71.5\n14) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 71\n15) THE SILENT SPY  * 70.5\n16) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 70\n17) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 69.5\n18) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 69\n19) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 68</td><td>08 31, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC Download, null, null, null)</td><td>A MOONLIT STROLL WITH MEMORIES OF MICKEY MALONE</td><td>1409443200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The very first time I played this game (waaay back when it was first released), I found myself incapable of finishing it because I was just too scared.

Also, you really get an interesting look into the past with this game.\n\nI would not suggest this for people who get bored easily or are impatient because this game does take a bit of digging, and, as the title of this review states, it's not the most riveting game out there. You are stuck out on Moon Lake, which has a very small population of three people and you at this point. But it does have a lot of places to unlock, which is something I like in my games (finding new areas as the game progresses, rather than everything being handed to you upfront). Not that games that don't have secret passages aren't as good, they can be great too. I just get a little tingly 'I'm an adventurer' feeling when I find places that no one has seen in decades (or centuries, in some games).

I still love to play the games from the classic part of the series (games one through nine), and although this one definitely isn't the best of the first few games, there are still a few positive aspects in this one, you just have to look hard to find some of them.\n\nStory: 8/10. This story is somewhat of a rarity for the Nancy Drew games, because it's pretty much two stories in one mystery: Ghoulish ghost dogs appear in the middle of the night and try to maul Sally McDonald's house (the house Nancy stays at in the game). There is also the theory that a man named Mickey Malone buried treasure somewhere on Sally's property, which used to be his land. I loved the idea of two stories, and these two melded together pretty well, and were pretty well done.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 7/10. Since this game was released in late 2002, the graphics aren't going to be that amazing, but the setting was somewhat decent, as you got to explore a convenience store, a forest, a graveyard, a sheriff station and the actual house Nancy stays at.\n\nCharacters: 6.5/10. This game has one or two less suspects than usual Nancy Drew games (this one has 3 people that you meet in person), and they somewhat feel bland. You have Emily, the southern store owner, Red, the anthropic bird watcher, and Ranger Akers, the strict runner of the town who loves ticketing people. None of them are very colorful, and definitely aren't the highlight of this game.\n\nPuzzles/Exploring: 5.5/10. They're aren't many puzzles in here as there are tasks, and one thing that forces me to knock down this game's score is that exploration feels practically nonexistent. They're really isn't anything to search or sleuth in besides a frustratingly big forest and the occaisonal passage. But the few puzzles that were there I could usually do without hints, which means that they were really simple.\n\nActivities:5/10. Another thing that is pretty much nonexistent in this game. The only things that even come close to fun activities in this game are bird-watching and reading the lake's history on the Sheriff's computer. I would have like more plain fun to be added in this game.\n\nEnding:\n7.5/10. Some endings take a little bit of time to complete, and may even require a second chance, but this one is over very quickly, yet it somehow gives you that goosebumpy feeling that good Nancy Drew endings give you. I'm sure you know what I mean\n\nTotal (average): 6.58 out of 10, averaged to....\n\n6.5/10.\n\nWhile there can still be some fun to be had with this game if you're a diehard fan like me, I'd recommend that new Nancy Drew PC fans or someone looking for one of the games to buy, look at another HERInteractive title for now.</td><td>08 22, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake review.</td><td>1313971200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The Nancy Drew games are nothing short of phenomenal. Nearly every game before this one has held onto a classical quality of mystery, intrigue, and adventure. This wonderful 7th addition, \"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\", is no exception at all.\n\nThis game takes place shortly after the previous game. While interning at Beech Hill, Nancy's friend Sally sent Nancy a letter asking for her help. Something frightening has been happening ever since she's moved into her new home in Moon Lake, Pennsylvania, and she's hoping that Nancy can find out what. Nancy naturally agrees to drive out, only to find out that Sally's been frightened away from her home. What exactly did this? The answer comes all too quickly when pack of four ghost hounds that attack the house while Nancy's inside. Legend has it that they once belonged to Mickey Malone, the gangster who originally lived in the house, until their beloved owner passed away. Upon his death, the dogs ran off into the neighboring woods, and could be heard howling in the distance until they all died. They now return every time somebody tries to live in the old Malone home. Could these dogs be seeking their owner in the netherworld, or is a sinister criminal trying to scare Sally away from her property? And if it's the latter case, why?\n\nThe plot used in this game is truly a masterpiece. I've yet to find another story like this one. This case is definitely another stepping stone in the realm of Nancy Drew gaming, offering a plot unlike any other, and giving a fresh, new feel to the series while doing so.  The house is very detailed, and I loved exploring the nearby woods. The graphics are very beautifully realistic, and made me feel as if I was right there with Nancy as she listened to the beautiful birds sing by day or wandered through the creepy woods at night.\n\nThis game only has three suspects, which is a move never used before (all games before have had four, except for Stay Tuned for Danger with six). Some might not like this move, but I thought it was a pretty good one, because it left space for originality in the game. It also made it more realistic - really, if we were solving cases in real life, what would be the odds that we'd ALWAYS have four suspects every time?\n\nThe suspects include a retired antisocial bird watcher named Red Knott, who spends most of his time on his observation platform making odd noises to get birds out of hiding. Emily Griffin is another suspect in the game, and is the owner of a store called Em's Emporium, specializing in antiques from the 20's. The last suspect is Ranger Jeff Akers, the park ranger for Moon Lake who enjoys bossing people around. All of the characters had very solid motives to want Sally out of her house, but the most solid motives don't come to light until nearly halfway into the game. I wasn't really sure who'd be the culprit in the end, but was rather happy with the culprit choice that was made.\n\nThe other six games before this one all had excellent soundtracks. \"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\" is no exception. This game features a lot of music with a strong \"nature\" feel to it, and it was very peaceful to listen to while exploring the woods and around Moon Lake's community. At night, the music becomes slower and more eerie, and it was complimented by the sound of chirping crickets. The music played whenever Nancy's in danger was as suspenseful as always, but also had a bit of that \"dark nature\" edge to it like the nighttime music did. \"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\" is yet another example of a game with a perfect soundtrack.\n\n\"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\" is another term for \"a great step in the Nancy Drew series\". I can't complain about this game much at all, and everything within it is so rich and fresh. I love this game, and I can't wait to write about the next one! :)</td><td>06 25, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>More Fun than a Barrel of Ghost Dogs</td><td>1308960000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Now, normally I wouldn't have gotten this game. All the reviews say it's terrifying, and I'm really not into that. But, since I got it as a Christmas present, I gave it a try. And I will be the first to tell you that it's NOT terrifying, and it's actually pretty good! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy goes to visit her friend Sally MacDonald at Moon Lake because Sally says some terrible things have been happening at her lakeside cabin. When Nancy gets there, though, Sally has left out of fear. So Nancy decides to stay and solve the mystery of the ghost dogs who show up at night and attack the cabin. I thought this was a really good plot. Unlike in some other ND titles, I really wanted to solve the mystery and find out where these dogs were coming from. And trust me, the dogs weren't the least bit scary. The plot wasn't too short or too long. Another solid plot from Her Interactive!\n\nCHARACTERS - 4/5: There was a real lack of characters in this game. There were only 3 that you could actually see. I guess they did that so Moon Lake would really feel desolate, and it worked. The three main characters were Red Knott, an anti-social bird watcher, Emily Griffen, the store owner who has a fun accent, and Jeff Akers, the lone park ranger. Overall, the characters were OK. I kind of wish there was more, though.\n\nSETTING - 4/5: The setting was pretty good. I can't say it was beautiful or anything, because although it was well done, it was just kind of creepy looking. But there was lots to explore, including a whole forest maze that was really hard to get the hang of. There wasn't much to see inside the cabin, or around the lake, but the forest was pretty big so that made up for it.\n\nPUZZLES - 4/5: The puzzles were pretty easy in this game. I could figure most of them out without a walkthrough. The maze was probably one of the hardest puzzles, and I kept getting lost. But other than that they were all short and sweet.\n\nWAS IT CHALLENGEING?: Nope.

I liked how they revealed who the culprit was, and catching them was very clever.

She won't tell you over the phone what's scaring her, though, and when you get to her house, she's gone!  You soon find out that dogs with glowing eyes have been attacking her house, and they have scared her away.  You can call her in the game, so don't think she's been kidnapped or something.\n\nGraphics-They were pretty good, and the dogs didn't look that bad.  The characters still need some work, and the backgrounds could be better, but overall, I love the graphics.\n\nSound-The music has a slight country twist on it, and although I hate country music the music isn't that bad in the game.  The voice acting could have been better, but it's not as bad as it's been before.\n\nGameplay-The car you drove up in is blocked by a tree that fell down right behind it, so you have to get around via motorboat, which you have to fix first.  Also, there are only 3 characters in the game, so it really gives you the feeling that this is definitely not the city anymore.  Point-and-click is the same.  So is calling Bess and George for hints.  There is a tad bit of history in this game but not as much as in the last game.  Thank goodness!  You have to choose day or night, however, and you don't have an alarm clock in this game.\n\nFun-Yeah, this is a fun game, but as before mentioned in other reviews, the puzzles don't have much to do with the story, and they revolve a lot around Roman numerals.  The puzzles aren't great, but the story really makes up for it.  Still, the story is not the least bit scary, but it is still a great story.\n\nLength-Not as long as the last one, playing this one through is about 10 hours, but of course, the first time you play it, it will be longer.  It does have a replay value, but the puzzles are rather dull that I just don't bother with this game that much.\n\nA great game with an excellent story but rather dull puzzles.

It's really scary in the beginning and in other sections too. You have to snoop around at night and go to the graveyard! I'd say it is pretty freaky. But it's loads of fun. I only got stuck really bad ONCE during the entire game. That doesn't mean it's super easy but it just means that it's not extremely hard to the point where you can't figure it out yourself.

This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the \"ghost dogs.\" Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house.\nNancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or flesh-and-blood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Em's Emporium (Moon Lake's general store), Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the \"hauntings,\" and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail (where he died). Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger.\nAs in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if she's not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often!\n\"GDoML\" features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore: Mallone's cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map (the one included in the game didn't help me much). That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancy's progress onscreen.\nOne nifty feature was Nancy's PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types: numeric/dials/switches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an \"alarm clock\" setting to change from day to night since some tasks (and events) can only be completed then.\nGraphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done (the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs). The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple: all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360 rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters: in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lip-synching was really bad. In \"GDoML,\" at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun: in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearing-impaired players (a very nice touch), including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game \"The Haunted Carousel.\" Overall this is a nice introduction to the Nancy Drew series from Her Interactive and a fun mystery to solve with plenty of details and creepy moments.

In fact, I feel that it could have been better in so many ways.  Don't get me wrong.  The Nancy Drew games series is great.  In each game, you, as Nancy Drew, gather clues, interview people, solve puzzles, explore secret passages, and find the culprits.  The games are engaging, fun, and even educational.  And they're fun for both kids and adults alike.  The first game in the series, \"Secrets Can Kill,\" was well-intentioned but the character graphics (and the fact that you had to switch back and forth between two CDs) left much to be desired.  However, after \"Secrets,\" the games began to significantly improve.  You would think, then, that by the seventh game, the games would be stellar.  Not true.  I think they peaked at game three (\"Message in a Haunted Mansion\") and four (\"Treasure in a Royal Tower\").  It's almost as if, by game seven, the designers/creators have run out of ideas.  I don't mean for the plots -- I mean for puzzles, for character's wisecracks, that sort of thing.  Things that move the game along and make it fun.  Most every puzzle in \"Ghost Dogs\" was eerily similar to a puzzle we've seen in a previous Nancy Drew game, the only exception being the one you have to play when Nancy is in peril toward the middle of the game (this is not a spoiler; in just about every Nancy Drew game, Nancy is in peril about halfway through the game.)  That puzzle was fun.  But the others could have been better.  Also, in each Nancy Drew game there is some sort of educational element.  You learn things as you go along, from books, computers, newspaper articles, or signs.  But in this game, there was a HUGE amount of information on parks on one single computer.  Most of this information wasn't even important to the game.  Why is it there?  Who's going to sit there and read it?  With all due respect, I was just slightly bored with \"Ghost Dogs.\"  My last complaint (and I really don't mean to sound like a picky grouch; I love Nancy Drew, really, I do) is Nancy's personal data assistant that she carries with her now.  She puts all her clues in there.  She even carries maps around with her now!  One of the most fun things about the Nancy Drew games, for me, has been that you have to write down clues (on paper, in real life), trace maps, etc.  If I happen to not notice a clue in \"Ghost Dogs,\" well hey, Nancy (but I thought *I* was Nancy?) has already jotted it down for me.  And this was on the senior level!  I guess I could just NOT look at the PDA, but come on, it's too tempting.  Where's the challenge?  I really hope the next game will be better; from the promo, it looks very intriguing.  And I *do* have faith in the designers to make this next one a winner.  In conclusion, me just say this: if you've never played a Nancy Drew game before, you'd be safe to start with this one, since all the puzzle concepts would be new to you.  But it's not the best.  Still, if you're a Nancy Drew fan, it's still pretty amusing and so I give it 4 stars.</td><td>01 28, 2003</td><td>A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2</td><td>Molly P.</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Not the best Nancy Drew game there is</td><td>1043712000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00006OAQU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The seventh in the series, these games are relatively inexpensive yet provide hours of gameplay. In them, Nancy Drew, the college-aged female detective, explores mysteries and finds solutions to various puzzles.\nYou can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the 'snapshot' quality is more of a flow. It's still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go \"to\" a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a \"hot spot\" in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you can't click on something, it's not important.\nThere's no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games I've lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs don't actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning.\nThe game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons aren't in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if you're cleaning areas where mice live.\nThere are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like you're really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world.\nOn the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it.\nStill, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. It's not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have 'beaten it'. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, it's a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those \"little grey cells\" in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects.

It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.\nI'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation.

This is what computers have promised to deliver for some time now.  In this and other ways, Microsoft is finally bringing it to users in a usable, intuitive manner.\nPrevious features such as spellchecking, grammar, integration and smart cut-copy-paste operations are all present.  Perhaps the best addition to the suite is Microsoft's OneNote, which promises to capture freeform notes and text in whatever way you like, digitizing tablet handwriting or keyboard entry; the killer app is how it recognizes the handwriting and indexes the text for finding your notes again.  Call it system-wide Graffiti for Windows.\nStill, this is Office and the usual bloat in disk space, system requirements, and price tag all apply.  This is a release most-targeted for businesses that can afford to roll this out to many users under a favorable license.  If a company such as GE had to pay $450 a seat, you can bet GE would be using a competitor's product tomorrow.  So for an individual, Office is still a four-star player.\nFor anyone considering Office 2003, let me weigh in with a wet blanket on previous rave reviews: if you have Office 2000/2002/XP, you don't need this release.  Honestly.  This iteration does not contain a truly compelling feature set that will bring you to spend a few hundred dollars.  Microsoft's OneNote is good, maybe even killer, but you've gotten along without it for quite some time now, haven't you?\nTo put all this in a single paragraph: if you're on Office 97 or earlier, and can score the upgrade, and have the bucks, this is a good release to use.  However, if you don't have the bucks, Office 2002 or even Office 2000 are still viable alternatives that provide 95% of the features at 30-70% of the cost.</td><td>11 26, 2003</td><td>A2ZR3YTMEEIIZ4</td><td>Christopher Wanko</td><td>null</td><td>Five starts is debatable, its utility is not.</td><td>1069804800</td><td>false</td><td>263</td></tr><tr><td>B0000AZJVC</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.

The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.\nHowever, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.\nAnd Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.

Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.\nWord 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.\nExcel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.\nOutlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with \"Clear Type\" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.\nPowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.\nThis new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.\nPublisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher.

Outlook 2003 is easier to use than any previous version.\nMicrosoft Office 2003 is a complete solution for the home and business user alike. It is an essential tool for students and developers.

This version (2003) -- although superior to later versions -- did pick up a little bloat since 2000, and Help has largely become an online feature (not sure how much/to what extent), and that is mildly unfortunate.  Sad that MS _seems_ to be determined to somewhat ruin their flagship products in numerous ways (??) -- but very grateful their outstanding, earlier products can still be acquired and used, for a while anyway.\n\nSo, although not quite as hot as Office 2000, this 2003 version is more current concerning file formats, and new features that are needed on occasion.

So in these instances, you're going to want a version that is capable of dealing with the newer XML, HTML, what have you.

It may be a god-send one day but today it is still not a major factor and certainly does not demand a major update.  The RESEARCH option is something to contend with and could be quite useful - it is almost like having Encarta loaded on your machine as well.  I found it a bit limiting though; it is good as a thesaurus but there is no world atlas, quotation source, etc.  Many people have applauded the new look and feel of Outlook.  Again, it behaves just the same as previous versions of Outlook did.\n\nMicrosoft chose to retire the Office bar and that is a big mistake.  They are trying to push the Quick Launch bar but most businesses and almost all Office users preferred the Office bar.\n\nDon't get me wrong:  Office 2003 works very well and with Word, Outlook, Excel, Access and Publisher you can literally do anything!  It also preforms very well.  But, again, unless Microsoft starts making major changes, these releases should not be heralded as new.  If anything, they should be upgrades that former users should be able to download if they registered the original product - the cost is too prohibitive to justify upgrading.  And, as your Office 97 or XP works just as well, you should think seriously before spending the money.</td><td>01 31, 2005</td><td>A1QQDHM5YMLQ8Z</td><td>Joe Albanese</td><td>null</td><td>The latest version</td><td>1107129600</td><td>false</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>B0000AZJVC</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is the newest version of Microsoft Office.

There's much to like in this program; however, I've installed the upgrade on two different machines (the Small Business version on a Dell Dimension 8200 desktop, and the Professional version on an IBM T40 Thinkpad); upon intallation IE6 immediately began generating run-time errors.  I've been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found I'm not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  It's extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: \"it's probably due to spyware\".  Well, I've been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didn't exist until I installed this upgrade).  I can only conclude that any spyware causing these problems must be embeded in the upgrade!\nSo, beware of the potential for IE6 run-time errors if you install Office 2003.  Also, if you use Act! (or a similar program) that runs on top of Outlook, you'll find that a supposed new security feature in Outlook requires you to manually permit Act to retrieve e-mail from Outlook every time new mail arrrives.  It's a real pain!!!\nTo summarize, there's not enough in this upgrade to justify putting up with these problems (or features, in Microsoft parlance), and I wouldn't have upgraded had I known what I was in for.</td><td>11 4, 2003</td><td>A1GOKUUDRB63FQ</td><td>Stratman351</td><td>null</td><td>A mixed bag...nice features, but seems to bug laden</td><td>1067904000</td><td>false</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>B0000BX73E</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.

The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.\nHowever, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.\nAnd Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.

Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.\nWord 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.\nExcel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.\nOutlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with \"Clear Type\" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.\nPowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.\nThis new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.\nPublisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great.

Macros work okay, but are best written up in the macro editor. Text for use outside of Word is best saved as a plain Text file, and any formatting done within the destination application. Framemaker, for example.\n\nWord is a good word processor and is not a DTP application to any useful extent. And used in its word processor mode, it does compare more than favourably with any alternative that I have tried. And that's quite a few.

It's also a good idea to visit and subscribe to word tips, who have a huge amount of advice about Word in general and macros in particular.\n\nAll in all, there's not too much to complain about if the aforementioned is observed.

This would have been the fourth upgrade since I already own Norton Internet Security and System Works for 2001, 2002, and 2003. This new activation scheme is outrageous!!! I did not use any pirated software and I don't intend to start now but I change my hardware a lot and reinstall applications and I find that by requiring product activation Symantec hits me as a legitimate user since the product allows only 5 activations. In 4 months I will be unable to use it if I reinstall the OS 5 times, and here I am, a legitimate user and a loyal customer who paid Symantec for 4 years unable to use software I paid for.

There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the \"download warranty\" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didn't want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.  But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all.\nThe run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down?\nNext issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called \"Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse\".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?

IT IS A SLOW PACKAGE and can not be used in the background without a very fast machine or else you will be on a serious go-slow. For that reason do virus scanning when you are not doing anything on your PC. The Live updater is great and brings your system up to date with the latest viruses and AD-AWARE!

To be honest this is a must for any system.\nThe only drawback I found was in the Norton File Protection system. This KEEPS files after you have deleted them from your recycle bin. You need to actually turn it off from the Norton Antivirus control panel and then go into the bin and delete items manually. This took me a few hours how to figure out properly but the documentation is online if you look for it.\nAlthough the package is slow - it is extremely solid, robust and finds those files that you need to remove. It may be a bulky added extra to your system but it will save your files some day and in this day and age you must have some protection (Try the FREE software packages out there like AVG and Ad-Aware to see what could be on your system!).\nLike I said I have never had any install/uninstall problems.

This may be coincidence, but without fail every single one of those individuals (about 5 or 6 computers in all) ended up being knocked out of commission by viruses. On the computers that have had Norton on them, since 1999, I have not had one instance of a virus.\nI know that this experience isn't everybody's, and I know that no program can stop all viruses all the time, but so far Norton has a perfect record for me, so I will keep using it. Now that they have developed the Bloodhound feature to protect against new and unknown viruses, I'm assuming that it will be even better.\nMy one warning is that right out of the box, Live Update is not activated. I don't know why this is as many of my family who have installed it themselves do not manually activate it (since they didn't know they had to) and therefore operate with really old virus definitions until I go into the settings and turn LiveUpdate on.\nI have not hesitate to recommended Norton for every computer that my extended family has purchased.

I have stuck with the program because it works and works well, and with each new release it works even better.  For those who use Norton Antivirus 2003, there is little difference in the program, and perhaps the primary reason to move the newer version is the renewed subscription you will receive; the interface is the same.  Rather than radically changing the program from year to year, Symantec has made little improvements which enhance overall performance.  The results have been the consistency of a program that does the job of stopping viruses and does it well.\nInstallation:\nInstallation of Norton Antivirus 2004 is as straight forward as it is easy.  Barring any gaffes, the program will install and then ask you to register with Symantec which I recommend since this will setup the virus signature subscription program which lasts a year.\nTechnical Note: A virus signature is a file which contains information the antivirus program needs to defeat viruses and clean infected files.  Without updated signature files the anti-virus program would soon become outdated.  Symantec, through Live Update, continually downloads new signature files to Norton Antivirus 2004 via a subscription service which is part of the program.  However, the service lasts only a year and must be renewed-for a fee of course.\nUsers-like me-who also use Norton Internet Security 2003 (which shipped with Norton Antivirus 2003), will find that the program also interoperates with Norton Antivirus 2004.  During the installation process the older version will be removed and Norton Antivirus 2004 will be integrated with Internet Security 2003.\nAs is the trend in software these days, Norton Antivirus 2004 will have to be \"activated\" either by the Internet or phone within 15 days of installation or it will stop working.\nUpon completion of the installation process Live Update will run and update the program with the latest program files and virus signatures.  Live Update will continue to run in the background (whenever you are on the Internet) in order to keep Norton Antivirus 2004 up to date.\n\nFirst Impressions:\nI am still impressed by this program.  As I stated above I have used Norton Antivirus for a number of years and I have grown to respect its functionality.  Symantec has fixed the once vexing problem that plagued earlier releases of Norton Antivirus, resource allocation, as the program had a tendency to consume more than its share.  This is no small issue since the program runs in the background.  However with the release of Norton Antivirus 2003, Symantec licked the resource issue, resulting in a much better functioning program.\nThe sole purpose of an antivirus program is to protect your computer from viruses and this is where Norton Antivirus 2004 outshines the rest. Norton Antivirus 2004 protects your computer in the background in three primary ways:\n* Auto-Protect: protects your computer in the background by continuously monitoring system files for malicious code, including the boot sector, and memory.  Also checks files as they are downloaded from the Internet or from a floppy or other removable disk.  This option can be turn off.\n\n* Inbound & Outbound Email Scanning: as the title implies, Norton Antivirus 2004 integrates with your email program and automatically scans incoming and outgoing email, or can be set up to scan either.  In the case of outgoing mail a small box will pop up from the task bar indicating scan progress.  And incoming virus via an email will result in a popup box asking you what you want done with the offending code.  This option can be turn off.\n* Script Blocking: monitors script-based viruses like those encoded in emails of applets executed from the Internet, and alerts you to such behavior, stopping these viruses before they can infect your computer.  This option can be turn off.\nI utilize all three options because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and I continually receive email, both personal and professional.  Just today Norton Antivirus 2004 detected three viruses in spam sent to one of my email addresses.  To me, the program pays for itself the very first time it saves your computer from a malicious attack.\nVirus Scanning:\nNorton Antivirus 2004 can accomplish virus scanning manually or via scheduled events which you can control.  Manual scans can be accomplished at any time and the option exists to scan the following:\n* My Computer\n* Scan all removable drives\n* Scan all floppy disks\n* Scan drives\n* Scan folder\n* Scan files\nCustom scan jobs can also setup and run immediately, or scheduled to run at a later time.  I have setup the program to scan my network drives every Saturday night at 2:00 A.M. and my computer at the same time on Sunday, thereby freeing me from worrying about doing a complete scan on a regular basis.  Norton Antivirus 2004 does it for me!\nConclusion:\nVirus protection has gone from a nice-to-have utility to a necessity that every computer connected to the Internet, or a network (work or home), or used jointly, cannot do without.  For me Norton Antivirus 2004 is the best anti-virus program on the market, and I highly recommend it.</td><td>11 17, 2003</td><td>A3QMJMTLJC34QC</td><td>Vincent E.

This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend.\nBesides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.\n Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.\nAs usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you're really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive!

Well, you know that never works out especially when Katie is involved with controversy concerning a lone Orca that made its way onto the coast.  The whale isn't leaving and Kati's boat is sabotaged. Many reasons crop up? Was it because she won't sell out to a local tour company? Is it because she is intimately involved in whale correspondence?  Hmmmm.....[as ND would say].\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 87\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nKatie Firestone: She is involved in repairing her engine the WHOLE adventure! I really don't have confidence she knew what she was doing in regards to mechanical repair.  But, I guess she had nobody she trusted and it seemed it all happened in 24 hours [which is weird]. I didn't expect her to be the culprit at any point.\n\nHolt Scotto: For someone running for a political position such as Harbormaster, he can get pretty mouthy.  It's probably the sailor in him [ya know, you can never take the sailor out of the man....:) ].  I loved his personal quiz. Using the internet wasn't such a problem, but I was a little surprised on how much the game made me rely on it.  I'd have liked it if HER could have included a couple more local characters that provided that information through their life experiences. I know that HER doesn't flesh out it's character list with bodies that don't interact with Nancy directly, but it was also strange to hear the hustle and bustle of the Hot Kettle Cafe patronage when the place was vacant the entire adventure!\n\nAndy Jason: This guy gave me the chills.  He seemed a tool; was that it? Was it the \" Whale Rules!\" anthem he irritated me by? I don't know, but I had him as my # 1 culprit because the other characters just didn't fit the profile.\n\nJenna Deblin: She really thought a lot about herself, but she knew how to cook! I had a chance to eat her muffins, but was never given another chance at them after the initial offering! I thought that was quite odd.\n\nHilda Swenson: This was a major character that ND never had the benefit of seeing. I don't remember another situation like that throughout the games I have played that avoided direct contact. I guess I was okay  with that.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nThe moodiness of the Pacific Northwest coastline was captured perfectly with fog and drabness.  The sounds of the sea [water splashing] and beach was above par.  The music had you captured in the moment when you were on a small mission and knew when to be subtle when you entered a building.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 88\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The chess game I got from Holt's book was awesome and right up my alley because I am pretty proficient.  I already knew about poker scoring and the plaque punch to earn a royal flush was just okay. The coordinates challenge really bothered a lot of reviewers, but I was fine with that whole system. In general, there was nothing that captured my fancy.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87\n\nADVENTURE ENDING:  The new scenario aboard the ship was quite interesting although I wished I could have explored more aboard the deck.  I was happy to interact with the orca whale, but I always have the nervousness in the back of my mind what they can do to humans if they are angered.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 87\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me three days [10 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 75\n\nMy Strong Points: I guessed the culprit immediately and I didn't waver off my initial thoughts.  I really didn't need a walkthrough for most of the adventure and I navigated well through the bay's waters via kayak.\n\nMy Weak Points: A couple puzzles were greatly confusing [sea cave snake puzzle & the wood identification]. I thought I was doing a good job with the descriptions and apparently I wasn't!\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I felt my enjoyment level was suppressed the entire game. Was it the gloomy atmosphere, was it the uninviting characters? I know that I wanted to solve the mystery, but there was no hold over me where i felt enthusiastic.

Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending).

Also, after looking at several other games, I've come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isn't the most exciting game, so if you're looking for a game to get into the series with I'd point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch.

While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.\n\nBeing a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:\n\nStory: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.\n\nCharacters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.\n\nPuzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.\n\nActivities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.\n\nEnding: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.\n\nTotal (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....\n\n8/10.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you don't already have it, it's probably my second favorite one in the series (behind \"Secrets of the Old Clock.\").</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>One of my favorite Nancy Drew games ever!</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0000CEM5O</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The last 6 Nancy Drew games have all been exceptional. They're so easy to get immersed in, with hours of fun and detective work being spent playing them. \"Danger on Deception Island\" continues this great series on a wonderful route, and continues to be one of the best Nancy Drew games released to this date.\n\nNancy's friends Bess and George have arranged a vacation for her. Nancy will be staying with Katie Firestone, a marine biologist friend of George's, in Snake Horse Harbor, Deception Island (one of the San Juan Islands off the cost of Washington state). Nancy is immediately greeted by Katie, who was just getting back to her houseboat from getting groceries. When the two make it back to the boat, they discover that it's been ransacked and vandalized. Could this be the latest work done by an unknown group that's been robbing shops around town? Not only that, but an orphaned killer whale has recently made home in the harbor surrounding the town, and seems to be hanging around all by itself for no apparent reason.  Just who did this to Katie? Who are these vandals and robbers? And what's the real deal with this orca? It's now up to Nancy to submerge herself into the dangers surrounding Snake Horse Harbor to find the truth...\n\n\"Danger on Deception Island\" employs amazing graphics. Even though this game is a bit older, several of the graphics in this game could rival those used in games today. The suspects look so realistic that they almost look like actual actors and actresses. The graphics seen while kayaking, exploring the town, and walking on the beaches are nothing short of beautiful. Some real (or at least, realistic) photos of sea life are also presented throughout game play, which is a definite bonus. I felt like I was actually walking through a town by the beach while playing this game, instead of just playing a game featuring one.\n\n\"Danger on Deception Island\" has some of the best mini games, puzzles, and challenges that had been seen in Nancy Drew games upon its release. I especially enjoyed the mini games in Whale World (one of the explorable areas in the game). However, are several ways to die multiple times in this game (which doesn't bother me, but does some others), and one of the puzzles that involves getting a set of coordinates is very challenging and time-consuming. Aside from that puzzle, I can't complain at all.\n\nAll of the characters had their quirks, but they were a pretty well-casted bunch. Every suspect fit the story rather nicely, and they all had moments when they looked like they could be the culprit. The culprit becomes rather shocking, as there are several clues that come up and point toward another character(s) at the end of the game, until the ultimate truth is revealed. I could hardly wrap my mind around the fact that this character was the guilty party, but it was definitely a very tasteful twist (though I still would've slightly preferred the culprit being somebody else).\n\nThe first suspect met is Katie Firestone, who's a friend of George's and a marine biologist. She's pretty strong-willed, and definitely has some secrets that she's hiding from Nancy. Holt Scotto is an elderly fisherman who's running for harbor master, and doesn't particularly like Katie's defense of a policy that forces boats to stay several feet away from the whale (as he has to take the long way to get out to sea). Jenna Deblin is the owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and thinks Katie has a lot of secrets as to what she truly wants to do with the whale (i.e. study it instead of help it). Andy Jason is the owner of Whale World, a tourist attraction that specializes in educating visitors in facts about whales, and wants Katie to sell out to him.\n\nWhat really made the characters awesome was dialogue shared between Nancy and her phone friends. The conversations had with Bess and George and Frank and Joe Hardy were all very nicely scripted. Not a single one ever felt boring. The one-time phone friends were pretty memorable in their own ways too, such as Casey Porterfield (who constantly has a hard time understanding Nancy) and Hilda Swenson (she's so... well, I'll let you find out for yourself). The phone friends in this game were much better than the phone friends in several games were, and I would definitely like to see some of the one-timers make a second appearance.\n\nThe musical score in this game was awesome, which could be said about every single game created before it. However, this game does have a bit more going for it musically, as it definitely goes out of its way to make itself unique. The game features a lot of songs that sounded like they belonged in a movie about sailors, or from a kid's special to educate children about the seas and those who travel them. I felt like it went out of its way to make itself more \"beachy\" than other soundtracks have to make themselves \"scarier\" or more \"royal\". The realistic sounds of waves, seagulls, and seals made the music all the more fitting.\n\nSo, is Danger on Deception Island the best Nancy Drew game ever? I'd say it ranks among them. There are very few complains that I can make about this game, as nearly everything about it goes above and beyond. I would love to see Nancy re-visit Deception Island in a future case, as well as meet several of the characters she met here again. The game is *THAT* good!</td><td>06 27, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Fun on an Island of Dangerous Deception!</td><td>1309132800</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0000CEM5O</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I had VERY high expectations for this game, and I'm happy to say that it met all of them! It's definitely one of my new favorites! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited to Snake Horse Harbor to go whale watching with Katie Firestone. But when Nancy gets there, she discovers Katie's boat has been vandalized. Somebody in Snake Horse Harbor is up to something illegal, and it's up to Nancy to figure who it is! I thought that the plot was excellent. It was really intriguing and had lots of twists and turns and really kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot was so unique and fun, it's a perfect example of just how awesome Nancy Drew games can be!\n\nCHARACTERS - 5/5: There was a good amount of characters in this game, and they all had incriminating evidence against them, so it was practically impossible to guess who the culprit was! There was Katie Firestone, a marine biologist who's nice, but virtually everyone in town hates her. Then there's Holt Scotto, and old school fisherman who's running for political office as Harbormaster. Jenna Dublin, who runs the local cafe and especially hates Katie. Then there's Andy Jason, who owns a whale museum and rivals Katie's whale watching tours. I think Andy was my favorite person to talk to because it was hilarious every time he said \"And remember...WHALES RULE!\" And, of course, there was the orca herself, who was very cute!\n\nSETTING - 5/5: The setting was really well done. I've been to Washington State, and this game captured exactly what the beaches look like there. It was foggy, but very beautiful. Plus, the cafe was friendly feeling and the stained glass was really pretty. The whale museum looked just like a real museum. Everything in this game was so realistic. And the music was really cheerful and nice, and it never got annoying or repetitive, which was great.\n\nPUZZLES - 5/5: The puzzles in this game were also wonderful. There was just enough so that you didn't feel like you were doing a puzzle every second, but you still always had something to do. Plus the puzzles were challenging, not so much that you get frustrated and want to quit, but just enough so that they're exciting and fun. That's another thing, the puzzles in this game were actually FUN, and as much as I enjoy this series, I can't say that a lot of the puzzles in the other games are fun. They're challenging, but not very much fun. But I can honestly say that I had a blast playing this game!\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING?: Yeah, it's just the right amount of challenge. It was hard, but not so hard that I got frustrated or tired of it. It was really just perfect, I'd give it a 4.5.\n\nENDING - 5/5: The ending was so exciting. Snooping around, I really felt like I was in danger of being caught. Plus there was a big twist at the end in terms of revealing the culprit. I was surprised how scary the culprit got at the end, they just looked so evil! Catching them was fun, it took me a while to figure it out, but once I did I was very pleased. It was a fantastic ending to a fantastic game!\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 5\nSetting: 5\nPuzzles: 5\nChallenge: 4.5\nEnding: 5\n= 29.5 divided by 6 = 4.9 rounded to 5</td><td>09 25, 2010</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>A New ND Favorite!</td><td>1285372800</td><td>true</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0000CEM5O</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is one of the best games in the series, I think, but there are just a few tiny issues I have with it, and therefore, I can not give it 5 stars.  However, this what I thought of it.\n\nStory-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of George's friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katie's boat.\n\nGraphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.\n\nSound-The music is not that upbeat.  It's rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, it's usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.\n\nGameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.\n\nFun-Other than that, the game's puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katie's boat.\n\nLength-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.\n\nThis is a near perfect game, but because of just a few flaws I have to take a star away.  Don't let that discourage you from getting it, though.

You can spend time out on the water in a kayak, eat a bowl of hearty chowder (or maybe a blueberry muffin) in the Hot Kettle Cafe, read about the local sea monster, build sand castles on a remote beach and dig for clams in the sand.\n\nThe only thing missing is maybe romance.

There was an error copying files and no matter what I did, it wouldn't fix it, even following HI's advice on the technical support board. Running the game from the disc rather than installing to my computer fixed the problem completely though.\n\nOverall, I think this one is the pinnacle of HI's goodness.\n\nIf you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you.

Pleased with so fine a product, I bought many over the years.  Certainly OS X (Panther) has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance.  But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before.  Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems.  I can now.  Before, I could find things.  And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders.  If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent.  I could see the folders open, one inside the other.  And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively.  No more.  In OS X, I haven't a clue.  I do have a 750-page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther.  With a trembling finger on the step-by-step instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully.  I know the red buttons close something-sometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window.  (Which I've learned to find after a brief but infuriating search.)  There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I can't say what they do just now.  It's all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason.  If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green?  Don't bother; logic is no guide in Panther.  And that encapsulates the problem.  In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized.  The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.  Try to console yourself with that tradeoff the next time you face the spinning beach ball of death.  Hint: Erase your hard-drive and re-install everything.  A rock after all is a rock.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the Dock.  I've read (several times) the twenty-page introduction that explains just how easy the Dock is to use.  I condensed all that to a half page of notes, which I've misplaced.  But the little icons do look nifty.  And they do bounce happily-like little corpses on deliberators.  In fact OS X has all the chrome gleam and high-tech awe of a modern hospital.  Yes it is wonderful how technology can keep a body alive on antibiotics, feeding tubes, and assisted breathing.

Even administrator tasks can be handled with ease. There are an abundance of setup utilities (\"wizards\") and familiar system preferences (like control panels.)\nThe Macintosh has always meant simplicity, ease of use, powerful utility and just plain fun. Panther continues the tradition and enhances the experience.\nShould you upgrade? Panther works for all G4 & G5 based Macs and MANY G3 systems. (PowerBook G3 Wallstreet and original PowerBook G3, G3 Beige and some other G3 systems are excluded from the supported systems list.) Essentially any G3 or higher Mac with built-in USB is supposedly supported. Panther has proven to be extremely stable. If you have a G5, Panther is almost essential to keep you up-to-date with all the hardware features and fixes becoming available.\nIf you have a G4, you PROBABLY want to get the upgrade to be sure to get the latest enhancements and fixes. Many of the graphical improvements require high-end graphic cards to see the benefit, though.\nIf you have a G3, first check to be sure your system is supported. Go to the Apple.com web page and select the \"Mac OS X\" tab. Then click on the \"Upgrade\" tab then select the link for \"Check the system requirements\". If your system passes muster, you may want to consider Panther because of the latest updates. You probably won't notice too many speed improvements or enhanced graphics capabilities. However, since it is a stable upgrade and has a number of useful new features it is worth considering.\nIf you have Internet access, getting updates is as simple as launching \"Software Updates\" from the Apple menu. There are many new features, outlined in the Amazon review and detailed at the Apple web site, \"Mac OS X\" tab, \"New Features\" tab.\nFor me, my favorite new features are Expos and Fast User Switching. With Expos, hit one function key and all your open windows slide aside so you can see your desktop. Hit a different key and all windows are visble, in miniature and aligned. Click on one of them and it pops to the top of the heap.\nFast user switching allows two (or more) separate users to use the same Mac at the same time. Each gets his/her own desktop and preferences. Select a user name from a new users menu at the top, right of the menu bar and enter that user's password and poof, your desktop becomes the other user's desktop. One user can log out and the other user can keep going. This is a real boon because both my wife and I are Mac addicts and still need to share one Mac (after all, isn't sharing what marriage is about?)\nOverall, I feel Panther is a worthwhile upgrade, but the price may be prohibitive to some.</td><td>03 3, 2004</td><td>A3GQSZ2RVVXDCZ</td><td>Jon Kreisler</td><td>null</td><td>Panther - An OS Come Of Age</td><td>1078272000</td><td>false</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>B0000E6NK9</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>A First Look - Mac OS X 10.3 \"Panther\"\nTim Robertson\nPublisher/Owner, Columnist, MacRelevant\nFriday, 10/24/03\nAs the masses await the Fed-Ex truck to deliver to their eager hands a copy of the latest Mac OS X release from Apple, Panther, MyMac.com presents our early, first-look at the eagerly awaiting OS.\nFirst impressions: Wow, this thing is fast! Running 10.3 on an Apple Macintosh G5 1.8GHz, we noticed a huge speed boost to almost every finder-level task. Opening windows, scrolling large directories, accessing other machines over the network, you name it, it seemed faster. But lets take a look at some of the unique features in Panther.\nExpos&eacute;. This is a very, very cool new feature that I am simply in love with. What does it do? Well, for the uninitiated, it gives you instant access to any open window from any program, including the finder. What Expos&eacute; does is makes every open window shrink on your screen, and you simply click the window you want to spring to the front. So what's the big deal, you ask? Unlike the old Application window in Mac OS 9, which will only show you the applications running, this shows you all your open windows. So if you have three Safari windows open (I never do, I am in love with Tabs now) this will let you see every window. What's more, when you put your cursor over the mini-windows, the name of the window is displayed. You really have to experience Expos&eacute; live to appreciate just how much it is going to change the way you use the Mac OS. The only drawback for me is that it does not show any windows you may have minimized to the dock.\nTo access Expos&eacute;, you first set it up in your system preferences pane. For myself, I have Expos&eacute; activate for all windows if I put my cursor in the upper-right hand of my screen. If I put my cursor in the lower right, only the front application (including the Finder) will show. By default, three F-Keys are also set to do the same. Even cooler, when you click F11, all open windows move out of the way to reveal the desktop, and stay out of the way until you call them back.\nIf you have a multi-button mouse, you can also assign mouse buttons to do the same. I personally use my extra mouse buttons to launch applications, but I could set it up so that the scroll wheel button moves everything out of the way for quick access to the desktop.\nExpos&eacute; is one of those application that, like I said, better experienced than explained. I cannot get over how useful this is to how I would with my Mac. If it were not part of the OS, I would call this the next Killer App for the Mac.\nHeads-up Application Switcher. This is yet another way to switch between applications without using Expos&eacute; or the Dock. Mac OS 9 also had it. All you do is hold down the command-tab keys to bring up a heads-up display of the open applications. You continue to hold down the command (Apple) key while you \"Tab\" to the application you want. I used the same method in Mac OS 9 for years, and fell in love with it. It is one of the most missed features for me in Mac OS X.\nWelcome Back Labels! Yes, you can, finally, use labels in Mac OS X. But this, my friends, is labels on steroids! Labels work in all three views, Icons, List, or Columns. In Icon view, the label is a rich full color, rounded around the text. The icon itself is not colored, as it was is Mac OS 9. In List view, the color again does not apply to the icon, but to the entire line of the item labeled, so that the rounded colored bar extends across the entire windows. The same is true for Column view, but when you have clicked the labeled folder, the triangle keeps the label color. These may seem like not such a big deal, but they really are. Many, many people used labels to help find items, or to mark items that are of special importance, and it is a much-welcomed re-introduction to the Mac OS. Like Expos&eacute;, you really have to see the new labels in action to appreciate them.\nMany people are all up in arms about the brushed metal look, which is used in all the iLife applications, now being carried throughout the finder as well. These worries are unfounded, in my opinion. While I actually like the look, you can toggle it off if you wish. You do, however, loose some of the new functionality of finder windows if you do. Rather than having application folders, favorite folders, document folder etc&Eacute; at the top of each window, they are all now on the far left of your open windows. And they are all customizable. Personally, I think the new windows in Panther are a welcome improvement over the previous OS X windows.\nOne neat, though small, new feature is Apple put the often-used \"Software Update\" in the Apple menu. Clicking this simply opens the Software Update pane, but it does save one step in the process. A small update, sure, but one I have already gotten used to. And as the Apple menu is unchanged system-wide, you are always one click away from it.\nFast Switching. What is this? Well, if you share your computer with others, you will probably want to have multiple users accounts set up. A staple since the first release of Mac OS X, it was easy to switch to a different user. Now, however, it is even faster. When you activate \"Enable Fast User Switching\" in the \"Accounts\" pane in System Preferences, it puts the current users name in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It also puts in all the other names of any other user of your Mac. In my case, I have a \"Basic\" in which the system is basically as it would be fresh from the store. I also have one for my wife (even though she uses her own iMac, not my G5) and one named \"Kids\" which is for, obviously, my kids. (All they can do is create pictures in Illustrator or Photoshop, type up letters, and use Safari with bookmarks my wife and I approve, all others all deleted.)\nSo what happens when you click one of those names? You entire screen rotates; bring that user to the front. If the name is password protected, in brings up the log-on screen. And best of all, you can leave your account just as it is, with all the applications running, and switch users. When you switch back, everything is just as you left it. This is amazing technology I don't think enough people utilize.\nAll in all, Panther is a great OS. Of course, there will be some applications that will not run correctly and need updating, but that is true for any major OS upgrade. I am very, very pleased with Mac OS X 10.3, and think that for those with a newer machine, you will appreciate the added speed benefits and stability. The new features all work really well, and I look forward to delving deeper into Panther in the coming months.\nTim Robertson</td><td>11 29, 2003</td><td>A1VLVWTLV3LVHR</td><td>Tim Robertson</td><td>null</td><td>Tim Robertson MyMac.com First Look</td><td>1070064000</td><td>false</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>B0000E6NK9</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've been running OS X on my G4 Powerbook for over a year now, and I love it.\nJaguar 10.2.8 was running great so there was no stability reason for me to upgrade. Basically I just had to have the latest version just because it is the latest type of thing. Yes the system is quicker and there are some useful features such as expose, but I'm not sure it was worth the cost of the upgrade.\nIf Apple is planning on upgrading OS X every year then I probably could have gone along with 10.2.8 with no complaints and done a upgrade on the next version. I think Apple should have offered a upgrade version for those with 10.2 for about half the cost of what is charged for Panther. To pay full price for a OS  you expect major changes, like from Windows 98 to Windows XP.\nSo if you are happy with 10.2 and the new features in 10.3 are not something you need then I would stay with your current version and see what comes along next year.

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This \"smart-switch\" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.\n\nDesign:\nOne of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.\n\nThe click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.\n\nThe 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.\n\nThe 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.\n\nThe interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no \"power brick\" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.\n\nThe included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.\n\nConfiguration:\nI downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.\n\n' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.\n' Change the password - The default password is \"password\", so change it to something better!\n\nThe Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.\n\nThe advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:\n' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)\n' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)\n' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).\n' Port by port Rate limiting\n' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a \"disable\" setting to turn a port off if desired)\n' Port by port Broadcast Filtering\n' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)\n' Multicast control via IGMP snooping\n' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)\n\nNote: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n\nMost users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n\nGreen Power Use:\nThe 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n\nSupport:\nI did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n\nThe switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n\nI had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years.

I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n\nInstallation\n\nYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n\nHardware\n\nAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n\nThe array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n\nOne HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n\nI did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n\nA nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n\nDuring my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.</td><td>03 26, 2012</td><td>A2UL0DVTM8KVNV</td><td>R.

After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.

I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.</td><td>01 21, 2010</td><td>AR4NKM7NXG92G</td><td>A. B.

Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.

This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says \"T7Hub\" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for \"permanent\" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.

It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.</td><td>12 19, 2007</td><td>A37VWMG8U0OP41</td><td>Eric Thorson</td><td>null</td><td>Expensive but worth it for my uses!</td><td>1198022400</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001FS9NE</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Easy to install on XP machine, drivers worked great.\n\nLoaded quickly and easily, and worked!\n\nWhat else could you ask for?</td><td>11 21, 2007</td><td>A2E6P8E66HNRRC</td><td>R.

I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.\n\nThat device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).\n\nI wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.\n\nA bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.\n\nSetup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).\n\nAnother bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.\n\nThe downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive \"ethernet to Wi-Fi\" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.\n\nThe PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang \"g\") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps \"turbo\" mode in 802.11a!

When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.

It started early, in Message in a Haunted Mansion, and has been used poorly often (Trail of the Twister, Icicle Creek -- making the food, not the maid work, etc), but in this game it works. On a ranch, everyone pitches in. And really, the only thing you have to pitch in and do is collect eggs and vegetables, set up a camp fire, and feed the horses.\n\nActually, the camp fire was the only time I cheated, because I couldn't figure out where to get the kindling. I totally glanced over the true source because I thought it was part of the scenery, so I had a good laugh when I looked at the cheat. Don't make my mistake players. It's right in front of your nose, I promise.\n\nThe only 'chore' I didn't like was the one that had nothing to do with the ranch, though it was also fair. You do something for the lady at the shop, and she does something for you in return. I just wish it hadn't been so trying to collect all the arrowheads. Though here's a word to the wise: You can collect them at any time. So when you see one in the game, pick it up. That way you have less work later.\n\nAs a game, I'd highly recommend it to new comers to the series. It isn't my favorite, but that's mostly because my favorites, if you look at them, generally follow the same pattern (find secret passageways!). The story is beautiful, the 'dudes' are great (and so are the incriminating side stories that all three of them get), I loved riding on Bob (the horse), and it was just an all around good adventure-mystery.</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>null</td><td>This is the game where the chores aren't a bore.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Owning nearly every game in the Nancy Drew PC series, I'd have to say that one of the many things that HERInteractive excels at is the absence of repetition; Each and every one of their games feels unique and is lots of fun, although some may be more enjoyable than other ones. This one also has a unique location, a ranch in the Arizona desert. While sleuthing and the wild west don't seem like a match in your mind, this game is definitely an amazing edition to the series, and deserves a spot on any detective's game shelf.\n\nStory: 9/10. This game pretty much has two stories. There's the fact that a glowing white horse gallops past the ranch occasionally at night, and when it does, bad things start to happen. There's also the story that an outlaw named Dirk Valentine left treasure somewhere at or near the ranch. As the game went on, the two stories somewhat started to meld together, and it was super exciting seeing Dirk Valentine's treasure hunt progress.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 9/10. For a game that's seven years old, the graphics are still pretty decent even by HERInteractive standards today. Sure, the characters movements are still robotic in this one, but the scenery makes up for it; Which brings me to one of the big highlights of this game, the setting. It was such an incredible idea to put Nancy Drew in the wild west and shortly live the life of a cow girl. The music was absolutely perfect for the setting, and it was a very realistic experience for a pc game.\n\nAtmosphere: 9.5/10. Definitely the best atmosphere of any game up to this point, and possibly of the whole series. The AMAZING music fit the game perfectly, and the backgrounds (not the real pictures), were very realistic, and although I played this game on a computer like all other games in this series, I felt somewhat attached to the game's atmosphere\n\nCharacters: 8.5/10. The characters were decent this time around. You have three very different cowboys, and Mary Yazzie, a store owner a couple of miles away from the ranch. They each had their own distinct personalities, I just wish they'd shined through more often.\n\nPuzzles: 8/10. Not way too many puzzles this time around, which for me was definitely a positive. Most of them fit the game, and were a good balance in terms of difficulty.\n\nEnding: 9/10. A somewhat surprising and creepy ending. It's pretty simple, but still took me a few second chances to end the game.\n\nTotal (averaged): 8.83 out of 10, rounded to....\n\n9/10.\n\nA truly unique and enjoyable Nancy Drew game, the atmosphere and story is top notch, and this game deserves a spot on any Nancy Drew fan's shelf.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>null</td><td>Secret of Shadow Ranch review</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>After so many solid installments, one must wonder, \"what will the 10th milestone be like?\" I wondered myself back when this game first came out, as almost every game before this one had been a delight. When I finally played the game, it never failed to amaze me.\n\nNancy's going to Arizona with Bess and George, to visit her friends' Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed at their new ranch in Phoenix. Nancy arrives before Bess and George (whose flights are consistently delayed), only to find that strange things have been happening at Shadow Ranch lately. According to legend, the horse of an outlaw named Dirk Valentine haunts the ranch, cursing those who see it with bad luck. After it appeared the night before Nancy's arrival, a rattlesnake was found in Ed and Bet's room and bit Ed! When it looks like these attacks seem to be choreographed, Nancy starts seeking the truth behind this phantom horse, its history, and the truth about what happened to a legendary treasure that Dirk left for his love who lived on Shadow Ranch years ago...\n\nThe story became very gripping, and just who the culprit was going to be at the end was truly a mystery (pun slightly intended). There were quite a number of twists and turns that I never saw coming, but all were very tastefully handled. Overall, I'd say this game has one of the best stories (and I'd hope so - it *is* based on the bestselling Nancy Drew book of all time).\n\nThe graphics were definitely the best upon the release of this game, and still continue to rival several of the more recently-released games. The characters are all wonderfully animated, and their gestures and body language is very realistic. The scenery was very detailed, and everything appeared almost as if it would if it were encountered in real life. I also liked how the phantom horse was animated whenever it appeared.\n\nAll of the characters were rather likable, in the cases of both the phone friends and the suspects. Eventually, all of the suspects grew on me, to the point that I'd be disappointed no matter who the culprit was. They were so lovable, and remain one of the best casts to appear in a Nancy Drew game yet.\n\nThe suspects include Dave Gregory, the foreman of the ranch who seems very shy whenever he's around Nancy. Shorty Thurmond is the cook, who's as opposite to Dave as night is from day with his consistently running mouth and love of gossip. Tex Britten is the head wrangler, and has a very creepy aura and personality about him. Mary Yazzi is the first Native American character to appear in a Nancy Drew game, and she runs her own store on land adjacent to Shadow Ranch. They all fit together nicely, and the amount of interaction they have with Nancy is not only exceptional, but also the interaction they have with each other. Nearly all of them have something to say about each other, and we get to really understand how they get along with each other as well as with Nancy. This was such an awesome idea, as it makes the case much more believable and the characters all the more real and able to be related to.\n\nThe puzzles and challenges were pretty enjoyable. Several were challenging, but not impossible. My favorites were the mini games in Mary's shop and in Dry Creek (a ghost town that appears later on) and the cake baking challenge. I didn't really care for maze and flowers puzzles because they were exceptionally difficult, but two out of several isn't all that bad.\n\nI don't typically care for country music, so the soundtrack didn't stand out quite as much to me. However, this is just a personal taste, not a set-in-stone rule. Besides, the game *does* take place on a ranch. The soundtrack for this game should sound Western, right? So, regardless of the fact that I don't typically care for country, I have to say that the soundtrack is still as fitting and awesome as ever.\n\nWhile \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\" does have a few setbacks, it's a very strong Nancy Drew game. I'd say it still holds up as one of the best, especially in terms of characterization and plot development. It earned its spot in the top 3 games packaged in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites package, alongside \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" and \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\". Even though it's not a top five game for me, it's definitely a top ten that's well worth hopping onto and riding to the player's content.</td><td>06 28, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>null</td><td>An Epic Ride into the Shadows...</td><td>1309219200</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is the 3rd Nancy Drew game I've played (my previous two were #12 and #13) and I can't say its my favorite.

I'm going to split by review up into sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT - 4/5: Nancy is invited to Shadow Ranch, which belongs to Bess and George's aunt and uncle, the Rawleys.. But when she gets there, Bess and George are a no-show, and the Rawleys are in the hospital after Mr. Rawley got bitten by a rattlesnake. Nancy then learns that a mysterious glowing horse has been making nightly appearances at the ranch, and that everytime it shows up, a freak accident happens. She also learns about a outlaw named Dirk Valentine who, in the 1800's, was in love with a girl who lived on Shadow Ranch, and supposedly left her a hidden treasure somewhere. Could Dirk Valentine's treasure have something to do with the horse? Is there really a treasure? Who will stop the horse before something really bad happens? Well, it's up to you, as Nancy Drew!\n\nThis is practically the same plot as Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon (I guess it would be the other way around, cause this game came out first, but I played Last Train first so it's backwards for me) so it didn't really catch my attention. The plot was executed pretty well, though, but I still prefer Last Train. Everyone says how much fun the horseback riding was, but I didn't think it was that cool. You just point and click, same as always, except theres a horse head in front of you. But I will admit that by the end of the game, my horse Bob and I were pretty tight.\n\nCHARACTERS - 4/5: The characters were good in this game. They weren't really THAT much fun to talk to (except Bess and George), but some of them were intersting. Tex is the horse wrangler guy, he's tough, mean, down-right scary looking, and he doesn't have much to say. Mary Yazzie owns the gift store near the ranch, her character was boring and her voice was really annoying. The cook, Shorty, was nice, it was funny how he always wanted to gossip with Nancy, but I thought he was creepy looking, like a big scary teddy bear. The foreman, Dave, was quiet, but it was really sweet how he had a crush on Nancy. And Charleena wasn't that cool cause all you did was talk to her on the phone. Overall, I think they did a good job on the characters, they weren't amazing, but the voice acting was good (except Mary IMO) and the graphics for them were also good.\n\nSETTING - 4.5/5: This game is set in Arizona, and I think that the makers of this game did a great job getting that desert feeling. The decorations in the house were just perfect, and the ranch looked so realistic. The ghost town was pretty spooky, and the desert was barren, as it should be. The only problem I had with the setting was the music! The song was good at first but then it just got really annoying and repetitive. I would give the setting a 5 but for the song I'm gonna have to knock off half a point.\n\nPUZZLES - 2/5: If you were to ask me what was the ONE thing that bothered me about this game, I wouldn't hesitate a second to say CHORES!!! I hated them! Fixing the wire and collecting the eggs wasn't so bad, but picking those vegetables, AHHH! I got sent home like 20 times for picking unripe vegetables. I mean really, who sends a guest home for picking an unripe tomato? I ended up printing out like a map of the garden from a walkthrough so that I knew which vegetables to pick. But those chores were just a total turn off. I felt like some of the other puzzles in the game were also hard, I spent like an hour trying to do that impossible magnet thing, then another hour hunting for arrowheads on the ground. It was just ridiculous. I don't know, mabye there were some really fun puzzles in this game, but I can't remember them cause all I remember is that awful garden. The puzzles in this game are really not my cup of tea.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING?: YES! Unless if your an expert at collecting vegetables, baking cakes, spending hours searching the ground for arrowheads, and solving invisible puzzles. I'd give it a 5/5 for challenge, but it's not challenging in a fun way.\n\nENDING - 4/5: The ending is good. The maze at the end is confusing, definitely challenging. And if it weren't for a walkthrough I wouldn't have ever guessed how to catch the culprit. I was kind of surprised by who the culprit was and what their motive was. Overall the ending was good.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 4\nCharacters:4\nSetting: 4.5\nPuzzles: 2\nChallenge: 5\nEnding: 4\n= 23.5 divided by 6 = 3.91, I'll give it a 4 overall, but a 3 for fun.</td><td>09 7, 2010</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>null</td><td>Saddle up for...Chores?</td><td>1283817600</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>One thing I realized when I bought this game was that this seemed to be a good game just like the past 4-5, but HERinteractive wasn't really improving them to \"great.\"  I still liked this game, but I kept expecting HERinteractive to step it up.\n\nStory-Bess and George's Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed invite you (along with Bess and George) to their ranch in Arizona.  When you arrive, Bess, George, Aunt Bet, and Uncle Ed are all not there; and the hired hands won't tell you anything.  You soon find out that a \"phantom horse\" has been showing up, and everytime it shows up something bad happenns.  The latest catastrophe is that Uncle Ed got bitten by a rattlesnake and had to go to the ER.\n\nGraphics-Just a little bit better.  I keep expecting it to just get WOW better, but it never does.  The lips actually match the words much better, though.\n\nSound-Along with that, the voice acting for one of the characters you talk to is fabulous, while the other three characters seem bored.  This is actually the first game where I felt some voice actors/actresses weren't giving it their all.  The music is country which I didn't really like or dislike.  It went with the story, so that was good enough for me.\n\nGameplay-Everything is the same (first person; point-and-click; etc.) except you get around via horse.  It actually takes longer than in other games, and it can get quite boring.  Another boring thing are the \"puzzles.\"  Half of the puzzles are chores such as getting the eggs, feeding the horses, etc.  It's not brain-challenging at all, and for this reason I gave the \"fun rating\" 3 stars.\n\nFun-Like I said this game is OK, but the puzzles aren't really fun.  The story is fun, though, expecially the back story with Bess and George, but the puzzles are just work.  I hate work.\n\nLength-This game is about 10 hours straight through.  However, I wish they would have taken out the chores even if it resulted in lowering the game to 8 hours.  Seriously, the chores take about 2 hours in total.\n\nA good game that has boring puzzles.  With this game I was really wanting HERinteractive to come out with something great; unfortunately, the didn't.  I gave it four stars only because the story was great, and I loved the other half of puzzles that actually required the brain.</td><td>12 15, 2009</td><td>A3ANETCTMAN1NP</td><td>JJ</td><td>null</td><td>Nancy Drew goes to the country</td><td>1260835200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The Crime: A -\n\nBess and George's Aunt Bet have chucked their life in Phoenix and bought Shadow Ranch.

What's going on here?\n\nSuspects include cook Shorty Thurmond, store owner Mary Yazzie, and ranch hands Tex and Dave.\n\nFun fact - Mary Yazzie's character was named Mary Deer in the book. I don't know why they changed it.\n\nBy this point in the series, I was looking for something meatier than yet another tale of buried treasure and phantom animals.\n\nThe story is just too dang engaging to be ignored, though.

And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldn't think of anything better, either.\n\nGameplay: A +\n\nThe new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access.

Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. It's divine.\n\nTime Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.\n\nVoice Acting: A\n\nRaspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend.

The reason I did not give \"Secret\" 5 stars is because a few of the puzzles, such as having to collect vegetables and eggs twice are just plain boring. However, you get a real feel for the old west as the graphics are excellent. The Indian relics and ruins and the ghost town are very well done and the indoor scenes are great, such as Shadow Ranch Lodge, Mary's Gift shop and Cappy's, the remnant of an old saloon.\n\nThe horse lore that you will learn such as the proper term for each horse color is downright interesting. And as a ranch hand you'll be obliged to put a dismembered bridle together, feed the three horses and the chickens their various rations, bake a cake, run a barrel race and ride your faithful horse Bob to interesting places, sleuthing all the way.\n\nThe puzzles cover a pretty wide gamut of difficulty from the very easy (the vegetables and eggs and the chicken wire fence repair) to the reasonably hard-the Indian ruins maze. The number and variety of puzzles should please just about everybody except, perhaps, accomplished and sophisticated gamers. The latter would find \"The Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" a much bigger challenge for their abilities.\n\nThe voice acting is first rate and the lip synch and gestures are fine. Tex, the onery cowboy with an incredibly deep voice, is very funny. Dave, another ranch hand, is very cute, as Nancy noticed and points out. All and all \"Secrets of Shadow Ranch\" is a very pleasant experience, and even though it took me about ten tries to trick the culprit at the end (I get in such a flap when a puzzle is timed) I finally succeeded.

The reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time I've done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isn't any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult \"UHS Hints\" (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...\n\n\"Shadow Ranch\" is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).\n\nNancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...\n\nIn order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!\n\nOverall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, I'd recommend going to the \"UHS hints\" website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before you're given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you don't have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.</td><td>12 18, 2005</td><td>A1N2L9A6I686G5</td><td>Katie</td><td>null</td><td>Another Good Game!</td><td>1134864000</td><td>true</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>B0001XLSG6</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>The life on a ranch is not as easy as it looks.

However, Nancy arrives at the airport to a less-than-warm welcome from a ranch hand, only to find that Ed Rawley was bitten by a rattlesnake and is in hospital.  As if that wasn't enough excitement, cousins Bess and George are stranded at the airport due to bad weather, so Nancy has to explore by herself.\n\nA phantom horse has been sighted on the ranch just before bad things happen (broken pipes, downed power lines, rattlesnake bites),and it's up to teenage supersleuth Nancy to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding a historical romance that unfolded on the ranch between Frances Humber, daughter of the local sheriff, and outlaw Dirk Valentine.  Before he died, Dirk buried his treasure for Frances to find using a series of hidden clues, and the treasure remains somewhere on ranch property.  Besides Shadow Ranch, Nancy gets to explore a canyon full of petroglyphs, a Native American shop, a ghost town, and abandoned cave dwellings.\n\nThere are a number of suspects: Dave the ranch hand, Tex the head wrangler, Shorty the cook, and Mary Yazzie, a Native American jeweler. Nancy meets other characters over the phone, including a famous novelist, the local sheriff, and the Rawleys.\n\nSeveral new features have been added, including a larger game window, which I liked, although navigating a full inventory could be confusing at times.  Nancy gets to learn about horses, barrel racing and how to use a lariat.  To get from place to place (there are six major locations), Nancy rides Bob the quarter horse.  Nancy can search for information on the web with her cell phone, which provides numerous hints as to how to solve puzzles. There is a strong educational element here, as Nancy sifts through information on not only ranch life (cattle branding, barrel racing, picking vegetables, feeding horses), but numerous other topics (knitting, agates, petroglyphs, flowers).\n\nI liked the nature of the puzzles, although many reviewers complained about the repetitive chores, including daily egg collecting, vegetable picking, cake baking, and feeding the animals.  Nancy is expected to help out during her visit by performing tasks for various characters, including putting together a bridle, collecting eggs and vegetables, arranging a jewelry display, and collecting arrowheads.  There are a fair number of slider puzzles and several mazes. This game is more difficult than others in the series but not as hard as Secret of Blackmoor Manor.\n\nSecret of Shadow Ranch had a very strong story, good character development, excellent music (Spanish guitar, country western, scary music in the ghost town that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck), improved graphics, well integrated puzzles, and a satisfying conclusion (which I didn't find in Secret of Blackmoor Manor).

I suspect that Microsoft is partially trying to install some Vista style features ( ripped off from Apple ). In particular, I have seen Apple style \"sliding down\" menu boxes or whatever they are called. As an example, open the \"control panel\" applet. BEFORE, it was accessible, NOW, the elements at the top of the left column \"slide\" down. I had enough bad seizures ( bad in this case means very unpleasant - I can actually feel them in my brain ) that, after experimenting trying to disable this abomination, at had to get away from the computer.\n\nFor people like me, my computer is my lifeline. Since Macs are absolutely not accessible, we are stuck with Microsoft Windows XP. Vista is absolutely not accessible, as is Leopard, etc. With Microsoft destroying the minimal accessibility of XP, there is nowhere to go.\n\nIF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL SP3 - FULLY BACKUP YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN REVERT TO SP2 IF YOU HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ( I have two notebooks; if I cannot figure out a workaround, then I will never be able to install SP3 )\n\nBTW, I review so that other people like me can find information about products to avoid and so that they can realize that the problems that they are having are common to other people. There is essentially no accessibility any more. It is so bad that it is only a matter of years before we can no longer live in this society due to blinking, flashing, etc.\n\nWorkaround:\nControl Panel | System | Advanced | Performance - SETTINGS\nUnclick EVERYTHING that allows animation, fading, sliding, etc. I am not sure how comprehensive this will be but it helps.\n\nBTW, FULL accessibility demands that the display be totally \"quiet\" as far as any unnecessary motion or blinking. Unnecessary features that make Windows XP inaccessible are, in particular, \"progress bars\", animations for copying files. Microsoft Word has major accessibility problems. The animations associated with spell checking ( the IDIOT animated book icon at the bottom of the screen - every time you type the animations start.

With the introduction of SP2 in this minor update of Windows XP, Microsoft has decided to make the product \"secure\", than it was thought to be in the beginning. But the past few years have been rough on Microsoft, with consistency in attacks on the product with such vulnerabilities as Trojans, buffer overflows, viruses and the most memorable of the all Blaster (August 2003).\n\nEver since its debut, Windows XP has been causing a lot of headaches and wreaking havoc on corporate networks because of its susceptibility vulnerabilities that were not fixed in its initial release or Service Pack 1. So Microsoft decided to go back to the drawing board and decided to rethink what Windows XP should mean in terms of Security. At first Service Pack 2 was thought out to only be a minor Service Pack update with usual bug fixes, but because of the aforementioned problems Microsoft took new direction and after 1 year of testing we have finally reached a conclusion.\n\nSP2 is really apparent, based on my experience of installing the update, users displayed a welcome screen recommending Automatic Updates be turned on (and I would recommend too), after which the user is presented with the Security Center where you can configure the new and improved Firewall settings, such as which programs can access your PC. You also have the option of configuring your Anti-Virus program, unfortunately I have not been able to do so because my Anti-virus is not supported, although it seems (Norton Anti-virus Corporate Edition 7.6). Security Center is really the big change here and should have been implemented from beginning, but better late than never.\n\nOther great features which I and many users are undoubtedly thankful for include the Pop-Blocker which should have been included in IE 6 from the beginning (better late than never), its not 100 % percent effective but does a decent job so far of blocking most annoying Pop-Ups. I wish the Windows Team allowed users to train it, so if a Pop does succeed, you can tell the pop-up blocker engine that was a pop-up window and you shouldn't let that pass the next time, maybe Microsoft will let it improve over time. Other great improvements to IE in SP2 is the ability approve programs, so drive by downloads have become a thing of the past, anything you decide to download or accidentally clicked on a webpage has to be approved.\n\nAnother wish is, better integration of the ActiveX controls with Microsoft's own technologies, I notice that when I had to do a Office Update, the ActiveX API engine on Microsoft's Office website had to be approved before I run the utility that checked for updates for Office products I needed.\n\nMicrosoft has also streamlined Windows Update to be more user-friendly, you the user have the option for a Express or Custom install, Express only installs the most critical updates, while Custom allows to install the entire kitchen sink, including stuff some users can do without on Windows, (go with Express). Windows XP SP2 includes minor enhancements such as Windows Media Player 9, but why didn't Microsoft just wait a little longer and included Windows Media Player 10, which is already out? The blue tooth update is also a needed update, it wasn't intuitive right out of the box, but is more user friendly, all this, you can get for free if you are existing XP owner.\n\nOverall, if you haven't upgraded to Windows XP yet from older versions of Windows, this is the time, but if you are an existing Windows XP user, I say skip this and just order the SP2 CD or download it from the Windows XP Website. I highly recommend users running prior versions of XP especially 95, 98, 98 SE, NT 4 and ME, maybe 2000 also move to XP, since Microsoft is planning on porting any of technologies in XP to those older versions of Windows, plus it has some great new features and you will love the Security technologies that provide a better experience for you the user.

This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.\n\nMost important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.\n\nTrue enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.\n\nAfter the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.\n\nThroughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2.

But when you click on \"other versions\", you're quickly told that all Powerquest products (that is, any partition magic version < 8) are \"obsolete\" and \"unsupported\". They got rid of all the updates for PQMagic versions 3 to 7. Obviously Symantec is only interested in new sales and the dollars, not supporting former Powerquest customers (Partition Magic 7.0 is even listed and in stock for sale on Amazon.com!).\n\nPQMagic and Powerquest Drive Image have been always superior to Symantec's Ghost products.

Welcome to the Symantec partition resizing utility monopoly!. Symantec got rid of their main competitor and destroyed a product in the process. It's just sad.

Despite all the monopolizing and heavy-handedness and rushed updates, I have always felt they did more good than harm.  I have yet to find a Microsoft product I didn't like... until now.\n\nIn a word, Microsoft Money 2005 is \"horrible\".  I only gave it 2 stars because it still beats paper and pen :)\n\nNow, if you're a new user, you probably won't notice anything bad about it and will continue on your merry way.  Bravo for you (just don't do anything online until they release the second patch (yes, there's already one out) since 2005 is apparently quite broken with respect to about 50% of the institutions it claims to support).\n\nIf you're a previous Money user, pocket your $30 and invest it, using your old version to track the savings.  I was terribly disappointed in 2005.  To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, \"dual category lists\", \"in-register\" spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone.  What have they been replaced with?  I have no clue.  As far as I can tell, they've replaced them with a HUGE toolbar (a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize) and a LOT of white space (the register displays about 30 lines max (on \"compressed\" view) and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen.)\n\nThe home page actually displays less information (though it is prettier in a way) and the settings \"menu\" is a fiasco (again, much like MSN Explorer) with numerous hyperlinks that are not necessarily intuitive.\n\nFrom what I could tell, reconciliation seemed to work as expected, but seemed to offer less information than 2003 did.  I did not even take the time to get into investing since I uninstalled 2005 within 24 hours (and I am, without doubt, a \"give it time\" kind of person).  I honestly felt like I had less control over my finances (or at least less information with which to make informed decisions) and didn't want to risk botching up my portfolio.\n\nThat's about it.  I know it's a short review and probably leaves many questions unanswered, but I had only invested 24 hors in 2005 so a \"roll back\" to 2003 was fairly straightforward (and evidently necessary).  To take more time would have meant a more difficult reversal.  Again, I normally like MS products, but I can promise you this one will be going back to Redmond at their expense (30-day Money Back Guarantee).\n\nI would STRONGLY recommend against buying Money 2005.  It just isn't worth the money (I honestly wouldn't even take it free now).  I can see no enhanced functionality and it actually appears reduced in places.  The interface has been radically changed and, aside from being pretty, actually reduced my sense of \"control\" over my finances.  Again, if you're brand new to Microsoft Money, I think you'll be satisfied.  However, if you're a previous user... well... you've been warned...\n\nPS Did I tell you that Money automatically (read: \"Did not ask\") reorganized my categories?  It decided to treat \"Dining out\" as its own primary category instead of as a subcategory of \"Food\", effectively reorganizing over 100 transactions.  This might have been OK if Money had asked, but it didn't.  Makes me wonder what else was changed without my approval...</td><td>09 22, 2004</td><td>AAJIGWE242MSN</td><td>CJS</td><td>null</td><td>Stick with your old version and use it to track the savings</td><td>1095811200</td><td>false</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>B0002D12D4</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>There is a small army of people who, like the recalcitrant insurgents in Iraq, will do anything to try to destroy Microsoft's reputation.

As with any company, it makes some great products, many good products, and some bad products.\n\nI did not upgrade to Microsoft Money 2004 because, sometime in 2003, my Money file developed some kind of minor corruption (\"This operation cannot be performed\" error after entering certain types of transactions), and Money 2004 refused to even read the file.  This time, I downloaded the trial version of Money 2005, and it loaded the old-format file without a hitch.  And the mysterious error message is no more!\n\nMoney is cool because it makes it easy to keep track of your accounts, esp. for someone like me with dozens of banking and brokerage accounts (many from the days of Internet bubble when banks were giving away free money for opening accounts -- I knew I needed a real job...).  It's generates useful reports to track your networth, by category or over time.  Even for someone like me with lots of small accounts but little to show in the aggregate, it's immensely useful.\n\nShould you get Money 2005, or upgrade from an earlier version?\n\nI can't really help you with that question.  But I do have a couple suggestions:\n\n1) Download the 30-day trial copy of the program from Microsoft's website and give it a test drive.  I tried it on my two laptops and both copies worked perfectly, which led me to doubt the truthfulness of a lof of these reviews from so-called \"I'm not anti-Microsoft\" people.  (No, yours truly doesn't work for Microsoft or get paid by them in any way.)\n\n2) For a peace of mind, make a manual backup copy of your existing Money file in Windows Explorer.  Just go into My Computer or Windows Explorer, find the Money file (it's usually in \"My Documents\"; its extension is \".mny\"), and use copy-and-paste to make a copy.  Keep the backup copy in a different folder.  Better yet, zip the backup copy for extra security. :)\n\nTry the program and judge for yourself if it works fine on your PC.  Not all the naysayers are liars, no doubt.  But, as I always advice my friends when they ask about gadgets, movies and whatnot, always try it yourself and form your own opinions.</td><td>01 31, 2005</td><td>A5JLAU2ARJ0BO</td><td>Old-and-Wise</td><td>null</td><td>Works for me, although interface still not the best</td><td>1107129600</td><td>false</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>B0002D12D4</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>The reviews for Money 2005 are very good -- I suggest reading them all to see what you're in for.\n\nThe big problems for me were:\n\n1) The ability to have separate category and subcategory lists was removed from the transaction form\n\n2) I couldn't easily use the 'Transfer' category, especially in a split category\n\n3) Annoying duplicate account creation\n\nOn the first problem, Money 2005 uses just one combined category-subcategory list, so when you enter a transaction, you must choose a category-subcategory from one big list.  I prefer two distinct selections because it's quicker to enter and easier to find my subcategories.  Microsoft provides a Registery edit in the following Knowledgebase article:\n\n[...]\n\nI used the edit, and my separate lists are restored.  Great, but I am irritated that Money 2005 removed this option and provided no way for a user to change this behavior short of a Registery hack.\n\nOn the 2nd problem, my ability to 'Transfer' amounts to different account was resolved once I split my subcategory lists from my category lists using the above Registery hack.  Now, transfers operate as they did in Money 2003, which is the last version I was using.\n\nOn the 3rd problem, one financial institution has, for the 2nd time, downloaded duplicate accounts.  I hope it's an anomoly, but we'll see.  Other accounts operate fine.\n\nI haven't explored the strengths of 2005 yet -- this was just post-upgrade issues I've wrestled with over the New Year's weekend.  On the surface, doesn't look like much new is useful to me.\n\nOn the matter of online bill payment, I already had that through Wachovia bank (formerly First Union).  I guess what's new is that Microsoft now makes bill payment through Money work with many institutions.  Since Wachovia already provided this function, I don't think I'm adversely affected...or benefitted (though Wachovia dropped the $6 monthly fee for using Money's bill payment function).\n\nOne final piece of advice:  after you install, don't open your Money data file unless/until you have had Money perform all its software updates.  For me, I opened my Money 2003 file, was prompted to convert to Money 2005 file format, and then Money 2005 automatically downloaded software patches afterwards.  Wondering whether my conversion worked right nor not, I chose to open a backup of my Money 2003 data file using the patched copy of Money 2005, so any software bug fixes related to data conversion were already installed in Money 2005.\n\nI gave it a 2-star rating based solely on the upgrade process.

I truly hadn't thought that I would get much use out of this, but tapping f12 to check in on the weather report or look up the exact definition of a word has become something I do regularly.\n\nSpotlight works wonderfully to find practically any information that you could want on your computer, and it finds it amazingly fast. It brings back results that are both faster and more useful than any other hard drive searching method I've come across.\n\nAutomator is something that mostly power users are going to love, but it's a relatively simple way to make a series of actions you might do frequently into a process that you initiate and the computer takes care of the rest.\n\nFor those who like to develop applications or just try out writing a little bit of code, Tiger also includes a copy of the latest version of xCode, which is rapidly gaining popularity for developing OS X software (and it can easily be used to write and modify code in languages like Java that will run on other systems as well).\n\nThere's a long list of other improvements, though many of them are deep enough in the system that a casual user won't immediately notice them.  What you will notice is that the applications you use are running faster than ever, because while Apple has released CoreAudio and CoreVideo so that developers can make better use of your video and soundcards and get some of the audiovisual load off of your processor.\n\nOS X Tiger is now up to version 10.4.1, with 10.4.2 rumored to be in the pipeline on its way to release.

The Dashboard is my favorite feature - I use it constantly, for everything from looking things up on Amazon.com to posting to my Blogger account. The new Spotlight search is wonderful- if it can't find it, it's not on your computer.\n\nNaturally, you want to back up your data before you install Tiger. However, I found that all of the warnings I got about using the \"erase and install\" option were unfounded. I used the simple \"upgrade\" option to install it and it was completely trouble free. The only caveat I've found so far is that my third party software registrations were invalidated, but that happens with most OS changes.\n\nI haven't had a crash yet. The system doesn't get bogged down as quickly when I have a lot of windows open as it did in Panther. Even my non-Apple software seems to work more efficiently. I really recommend this upgrade for anyone who is less than thrilled with Panther.</td><td>05 7, 2005</td><td>A2V4P6IRCK1P70</td><td>Morgaine Swann</td><td>List(null,  Software, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Awesome!

This security suite hogs the computer's resources and wraps itself around it so you can't get rid of it easily. In essence, this software is the worse virus that ever hit my PC. I was shocked when I counted almost 100 threads belonging to this internet suite when the PC was idle. 100 threads!!! Especially if you have an older PC, or one with not a lot of available resources, this software will slow it down to a crawl.\n\nAnother issue is when Live Update fails or does not complete for whatever reason (PC crash, reboot, out of disc, internet connection disrupted, etc), there is a chance this software suite will start behaving unpredictably. This is ironic since this is the software suite that is supposed to be protecting your computer, yet it cannot reliably update itself when there are problems during the update.\n\nPerhaps their notion of protection is to slow your PC down to a grind, so if a virus or hacker manages to break through, it will be so slow they won't be able to do a lot of damage - this is my attempt at humor :-)\n\nBut to be fair, this suite seems to work most of the time. I did not have any viruses or firewall breaches - at least as far as I can tell. It has some level of customization and control, although you cannot turn off some of their annoying reminders. With rebates and bundles you can get it at a low price, but as always with mail-in rebates, you have to keep copies and records in case it is not received or lost in the mail.</td><td>01 4, 2006</td><td>AYNAH993VDECT</td><td>bsg2004</td><td>null</td><td>Bloatware at its best; Resource hog especially with older computers</td><td>1136332800</td><td>false</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>B0002UCSKI</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Four computers connected via wireless to the internet.\n\nFirewall and antivirus haven't let me down yet, used them for several years, easy install and options.</td><td>10 9, 2005</td><td>A5X444UZBWXW2</td><td>RM GRAPHICS</td><td>null</td><td>Long time user</td><td>1128816000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0002UCSKI</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>I purchased this product primarily due to the low cost post mail-in rebates.

They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging.

It seemed that (as far as I could gather from other sources on the Internet) there was a Live Update that slowed my Internet browsing capability to a crawl.

Faxes, marked \"attention manager,\" to the customer service department also were ignored.\n\nFortunately for Symantec, the problem was finally resolved itself three or four weeks later with another Live Update (after wasting dozens of hours of my time) but I forwarded some of the correspondence to the Investor Relations department, with the name of the recalcitrant customer service representative, telling Symantec exactly why I will never buy anything from it in the future.</td><td>03 20, 2005</td><td>A25PSIGEGEL7DE</td><td>William A.

One feature I really like is banner blocking--it just removes those annoying flashing banners that you see on most sites (ex. \"You're the 1,000,000th visitor and you won a free DVD player!

I really liked the 2004 version and have had no major problems with it other than once my computer boots, I always had to go into NIS properties to see if my EMAIL SCANNING said 'ON' or 'ERROR'.  Evidently, something on my computer will occassionally cause the email scanning to not load properly, so if it showed 'ERROR' - I would have to reboot and then it would be ok.  I should point out that Norton Support Staff told me even though email scanning said 'error', the computer is still protected by the 'auto-protect' feature if it is turned on.  Minor inconvenience, but other than that, I was very happy with the program.\n\nThe same holds true for the new 2005 - I still have the occassional email scanning 'error', but there are a few new  irritating things happening.  While the software works fine, it has tremendously SLOWED DOWN the launch of Outlook Express and it even hangs a second or two when I close it.  Also, if you open NIS properties screen, when I am finished, I hit the X button to close, but it takes like 2-3 seconds before it will close.  Even though these are just a few seconds, it really irritates me because I have a very fast computer.\n\nHowever, something that really excites me about this new NIS is that the hard drive scan of all files by Norton Anti-Virus seems to take a lot less time than it did with a previous version.  Being a stickler for speedy computer processing, this is definitely a plus.\n\nSo, overall, this program works OK and keeps me protected, but I still think there are minor issues they need to work on as mentioned and I also think that the average computer user is not given enough information about whether to allow certain things when a firewall warning appears.  I know so many people that have blocked innocent programs and found that they are unable to use them or get on the internet.  There should be a way for NIS to know what is innocent and what should be blocked... the average computer user doesn't have the time to research what they should block or not - in fact, isn't that the reason we use computers?

It requires activation, but that's the least of its sins.  Scanning is slow, and it misses lots of trojans and worms.

More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldn't call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.\n\nPLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.\n\nLike I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.\n\nCHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.\n\nSETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.\n\nPUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.\n\nIS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5\n\nENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nPlot: 5\nCharacters: 4.5\nSetting: 4.5\nPuzzles: 4\nChallenge: 4.5\nEnding: 4\n= 26.5, divided by 6 = 4.41 rounded to 4 stars</td><td>06 18, 2015</td><td>A13BTMCSLTQ48R</td><td>Llama Mama</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Puzzles Galore</td><td>1434585600</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Kept me interested throughout the game.</td><td>05 11, 2015</td><td>A19SRN7AX0VD9X</td><td>Faye N.

This lady detective heads on over to a 14th century English manor  reputed to hold a startling family history of intrigue, chaos, and scandal! Also, in recent events, a full-fledged curse involving a dangerous beast marauding the moors!  But to get down to business, she seeks why her neighbors' daughter is suffering from a strange case of [lycanthropy?}\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 93\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nLinda Penvellyn : I love a mysterious woman, but this is ridiculous! I really don't get the anger issues now that the plot reveal indicates the TRUE source of her ailments.  Was this just a woman who cannot handle stress or does she have other deep-seeded issues?\nI still have no idea what she looks like and I am not buying the game cover art because she was not involved in any real part of the storyline.\n\nJane Penvellyn : I really loved playing those games with her and I spanked her more times than not.  I sensed a little attitude with her at the end. I didn't know how to take that...\n\nMrs. Drake: I thought I would see more of her than I did especially since she was a main presence in the day-to-day events of the manor.  Then again, I never really enjoyed talking to her so I guess it was for the best.\n\nNigel Mookerjee:  A writer that was hired by Mrs. Drake to finally throw an encompassing tell-all [in a positive light] book revealing the exploits of the Penvellyn name.  I thought he was okay in general, but the typing test he had me perform was idiotic.\n\nEthel Bosinny: I really wanted to learn more about her and the fact that she startled me a couple time was really laughable. I probably never jumped in a ND game before, but they GOT me! :)  I wanted to learn more about what rituals/customs she was intent on passing down through the family lineage with Jane.\n\nNed Nickerson : Supportive as always.\n\nLoulou: A parrot that really DID get on your nerves after awhile. The voice was poorly-acted [sounding like a human mimicking a parrot] by whatever actor was in charge of that performance.  Also, if you were going to add catch-phrases, try adding at least TEN more. \"We are going to need a bigger boat.\" only goes so far after the 12th time heard.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 4 = 89\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nOne of the best scores I have heard in a ND game to date! Very enticing and it got you into the spirit of the adventure. Graphics, although not top-notch as the others, had designers working 24/7 because the immensity of what they had to  accomplish. So many areas of the manor were majestically done!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 4 = 93\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  I agree with past reviewers that there was a certain level of puzzle-solving that made it too hard for the casual gamer.  Mindlessly strutting around looking for leads would have added an extra five hours to my gameplay NEEDLESSLY, if I didn't short-cut with a walkthrough [didn't cheat the actual puzzles mind you]. I think they were too difficult for their own good and am trying very hard to remember if I actually enjoyed any of them.  The only thing that comes to mind is Skull & Bones and how Jane would ask \" Do you have any SPY-dehs??\" in her english accent. :) Go Dig!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 94\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: Now I don't mind not getting the culprit right, but when the set-up doesn't equal the payoff, I can get pretty upset. Why was I bothered to learn about this family in a historical sense? Okay, I forgive that, but here is what is NOT forgivable....absolutely no character  resolutions for the player.\n1) What was that wolf thing in the bushes? Was it real? If not, explain how it was faked! Same poor excuse like in SAWE\n2) Could Linda's ailments actually happen according to the explanation? No!\n3) What became of Linda except \"the family [Hugh/Linda/Jane] learned to grow together\". I want instant reactions to what happened immediately when the culprit was revealed...not a flimsy gloss-over going forward.\n4) No TRUE culprit punishment after all I invested? [13 game hours]\n5) What happened to all the side characters and their finality?\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 10 = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days  and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 56\n\nMy Strong Points: I battled to stay interested to the history of the family and even  memorized their family tree! [Where did that ultimately get me? 97% useless knowledge]  I solved the difficult games, but lets face it,  I am not spending four hours monkeying around with moving walls again and again. Why did I have to CONSTANTLY maneuver the gargoyle & dragon to enter the West & East secret rooms? Couldn't the developers put it as RESOLVED instead of the tediousness of doing the steps ten times throughout the game? I punished myself nonetheless, but especially because I had the culprit all wrong.\n\nMy Weak Points: General frustration with the game interface and it clouded my judgements on the linear tasks ahead.\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 56/ 2 = 70 [ C - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I'll not begrudge HER on how they wanted to resolve the main plotline, but for God Sakes clean up the ending so the Nancy Drew fans have some resolution on the other fifteen things that were occuring. We have invested countless hours and I learned nothing of how certain tricks were done and why. Should I just accept \"Because the culprit enjoyed lying\"?\n\nThus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, BLACKMOOR ranks.....# 18\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5\n2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87\n3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5\n5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER * 84\n6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL * 83\n7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5\n8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78\n11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77\n13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76\n14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72\n15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5\n16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71\n17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5\n18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70\n19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5\n20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69\n21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68</td><td>07 20, 2014</td><td>A1DER9ALIMLFBK</td><td>NightshadeBlack</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Blackmoor a BLACK EYE for the ND franchise</td><td>1405814400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I refused to use a walkthrough for this game. Absolutely refused. And players, I promise you don't need one. You just really have to put your noggins to work. Which I can understand why some people don't like that (who loves thinking? pah! -- I kid, I promise). I just really (REALLY) enjoy brain teasers and puzzles. I always have. My mother got me two huge books full of puzzles as a kid and I finished them within a month. That being said, if you like your games more straight forward, you probably won't enjoy this game as much. But that's ok too, there's a hints and tips forum on HerInteractive that you can check for assistance. And I promise, this game is worth completing.\n\nMy one complaint about it would be that I would have liked to have done more with two of the characters. One mostly just ignored you when you spoke to her (and I understand, she was very, very sick, but I wish we could have had more conversations with her) and the other only appeared a few times and you were never able to seek her out. I would have loved to have been able to speak to her.\n\nBut really, they're minor complaints. This game is rich in history, both fictional and some real, the spooky air is well maintained, and the mystery goes perfectly with the adventure. I felt a bit intrusive on the family, but that's a good thing. It makes Nancy as a character stronger. She is nosy to a fault. And I thank the creator for that because that creates amazing games.\n\nIf you're ready to take a challenge and be scared a bit, then you're ready for this game. But if you're looking for something a bit easier to complete, I suggest picking up Treasure in a Royal Tower instead. It isn't scary by any means, but other than that it has a lot of the same things this game does. Rich history and a lot of exploring. If you're looking for an easier scary game...well, they haven't actually produced an easy scary game yet (and I don't think Haunted Mansion/Ghost Dogs count as scary, Malloy is a meh game and I don't recommend it to anyone, and Shadow at Water's Edge, while being pretty scary, is also a bit on the hard side).</td><td>06 4, 2012</td><td>A3MGDZ4LX7CLXW</td><td>Katie Taylor</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>I love a challenge.</td><td>1338768000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>Having played almost every game in the Nancy Drew PC series (missing SAW and FIN), I know that each game has a certain atmosphere in it; Some are more dark and murky (Castle Malloy comes to mind), some are very light and whimsical while still being a mystery (Secret of the Old Clock?), and some have a nicely balanced mixture of the two (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is a good example). Although I usually like the dark ones the least, something about this game was very gravitational. When I first started it, little did I know that not only I'd actually like it even a little, but I'd write a somewhat decent review on it.\n\nStory: 7.5/10. Orginially, Nancy shows up at Blackmoor Manor, a massive mansion in England, to find out what is wrong with newlywed Linda Penvellyn, who won't show her face or communicate with anyone, with the exception of a few words. Upon Nancy's arrival, weird things start happening fast, and it's clear that there's either a supernatual being in the residency, or someone really doesn't want Nancy there. The Penvellyn family is HUGE, and it was considerably fascinating to uncover more and more history.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 7.5/10. The characters are still robotic at this point in the series, but they're slowly improving. Since you stay indoors the whole time (which was a negative aspect for me), you got to really see the detail in the mansion, but boy is there a lot. The manor makes you feel very small, and it's full of a lot of surprises and secrets waiting to be uncovered.\n\nCharacters: 7/10. The characters were considerably good this time around. To name a few, there's the intentionally nice but slightly irritating girl Jane, the hired author, Nigel who's writing a Penvellyn memoir, and Mrs. Drake, a strict and uptight lady. There's also Loulou the parrot, who's helpful and funny, but annoying at times.\n\nPuzzles: 7/10. Even though I had to use a walkthrough for almost all of the puzzles, they still took a long time to get done. They really got you to think, but to the point where you're cranium hurt! I think this game sort of over-did the puzzles because they're soooo many. This isn't called the hardest Nancy Drew game for nothing.\n\nActivities: 5/10. There isn't anything really to do outside of the story progression, which I found very dissapointing. I realize that the point of these games is to sleuth and solve mysteries, but fun activities are a priority in my book, and this game just didn't have any.\n\nEnding: 7/10. Maybe the most simple ending yet in the series. Somewhat surprising as well.\n\nTotal: 7.33, rounded to the final score of....\n\n7.5/10.\n\nWhile I may be a tad biased because I don't usually enjoy the darker games, this game does deserve a purchase for many Nancy Drew PC fans, but I'd go with something else for now.</td><td>08 20, 2011</td><td>A1543Y65HXSXZP</td><td>Jakob Balen</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Curse of Blackmoor Manor review.</td><td>1313798400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" is probably one of the most revolutionary games in the Nancy Drew series. First of all, this is the first Nancy Drew game to take place somewhere outside of the continental United States, which deserves recognition in and of itself (yes - Nancy's FINALLY going out of the country to solve a case!). Secondly, Nancy's suspect list has always before been equally populated by men and women, or has had two or three men to one woman. For the first time, Nancy has a case with mostly female suspects (three females and one male). I found this very interesting, and nicely thought through. Thirdly, this is one of the most challenging and frightening Nancy Drew titles, and was advertised as the most so when it was released.\n\nNot only is the game revolutionary, but it's also awesome. The storyline is very intense, and the history surrounding Blackmoor Manor is so richly detailed. It's amazing to see how much thought must've gone into this game, and I imagine it took more effort from the creators than ever before.\n\nA young woman named Linda has recently married Hugh Penvellyn, a wealthy British diplomat, and has gone over to start a new life with him and his stepdaughter in England. They live together in Blackmoor Manor, where the Penvellyns have lived for hundreds of years. However, shortly after she moves in, Linda begins to feel sickly and starts behaving bizarrely. She throws fits, hides behind a bed curtain all day, and refuses to eat healthy food. Nobody knows what's caused this change in her, and in a fit of desperation, her mom (who still lives in America) calls Nancy to ask her if she could fly out to England to find out what's happening to Linda.\n\nOnce she arrives in Blackmoor Manor, Nancy hears a sinister-sounding creature call out her name. When she looks around, she sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at her. Mrs. Drake, an elderly woman who's been taking care of the manor, answers the door, but not before the creature leaves. Mrs. Drake seems skeptical of what Nancy claims to have seen, but that doesn't stop Nancy from investigating. She soon discovers that one of the Penvellyns to own Blackmoor Manor was burned at the stake for witchcraft hundreds of years ago, and a beast she's rumored to have created had been prowling the moors for years. Could this beast have now returned? And why? And what (if anything) does it have to do with Linda? The answers to all these questions and more can only be found by solving this case...\n\nThis is probably one of the most unique plots in the Nancy Drew series.  This is the first time when she's not called in to investigate high-profile crimes, like murder, threats, vandalism, kidnapping, theft, and the like. \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" is also the first game to feature a family struggle that's turned into a mystery that Nancy is now called to solve. I enjoyed this plot quite a bit, and felt it was quite refreshing.\n\nBlackmoor Manor is beautifully detailed. The graphics used in this game are superb, and even though it was released way back in 2005, the gaming quality and graphics still rival many games today. I really can't complain about the graphics, save for the fact that Jane's appearance might seem a tiny bit disproportional (but she's also young, short, and sitting down on a bed, which is hard to animate).\n\nThis game featured A LOT of puzzles, but they were all very well-explained and served a purpose for being there. I liked them all, and even though others might complain, I personally cannot. I also liked exploring the manor, which is rather large and has many places and things to see. My sole complaint is that at least half of the exploration takes place in the secret passageways, and I would've liked to see more of the \"outer surface\" of Blackmoor Manor.\n\nThere were also lots of fun mini games to play, so the player can find something else fun to do in the game if they're bored with solving puzzles and want to take a break from the mystery. The character Jane has several games that Nancy can play with her. All of them have to be played at least once to progress the game in some way, but they can all be played again as much as the player wants to (Jane's always up for play!).\n\nAll of the characters were very well-developed, and all had reason for being at the manor while Nancy was staying there. They also all had something to benefit by causing the haunting and horror surrounding Blackmoor Manor, and for terrorizing poor Linda. The first suspect met is Mrs. Drake, Hugh's aunt with a self-righteous attitude and believes the British to be superior to the Americans in every way. Nigel Mookerjee is a historian who's been hired by Mrs. Drake to write a book on the Penvellyns, and is looking for something in the family history to \"spice things up\" for his book. Jane Penvellyn is Hugh's 12-year-old daughter who's been forced to return to the manor after living in the United States for awhile, and seems to miss her biological mother very much. Ethel Bosinny is Jane's private tutor who only appears every so often, and is very elusive and mysterious in the sense that she never seems to be found in the same place twice (nor can when she'll appear be predicted).\n\nThe other characters and phone friends are all pretty nicely integrated too. I absolutely loved the fact that Nancy can call Ned again (as he hadn't appeared in a game since \"The Final Scene\"), and the new method of getting hints that this game employed was very unique and fun. Rather than getting her hints from her phone friends, Nancy consults with Loulou, an 80-year-old female parrot who's residing in the manor. Loulou is very smart, and has quite a lot of funny comments to make about the case and everything involved. She's very well-scripted, and I loved talking to her because of how much comedic relief she added to the game.\n\nAll and all, the characters were great. I honestly didn't know who the culprit would be for sure until the end, but I did have my greatest suspicion leaning toward one particular person. This hunch was correct, but I was glad about that, as it employed two moves that needed to be done in culprit selection (one that'd never been done before, and one that was rarely done before). I won't say anything further, as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played...\n\n\"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" had a great musical score. I liked the traditional British feel of the music, and it definitely suited the location of the mystery. Every now and then, it also got more eerie, which also added to the overall fright factor.\n\nAfter being voted into the top three overall games, \"Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" was released in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites pack with \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" and \"The Secret of Shadow Ranch\". Did it earn its spot there? For sure! This game brought a true revolution to the Nancy Drew games, and remains one of the best even to this date. I've been playing this game for years, and I still jump a bit whenever I see phantoms and monsters creeping about the manor, watch clips of nightmares that Nancy has, or Ethel pops up in the middle of the night. It's a fun fright that's perfect for those who're willing to face their fears and solve one of the most terrifying cases that adventure gaming has ever known!</td><td>07 13, 2011</td><td>A3PD6NG6XL336W</td><td>Setsuna</td><td>List(null, null, null,  PC, null, null, null)</td><td>Only the Fearless Dare Walk These Halls...</td><td>1310515200</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B0002ZALES</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>In my humble opinion this is probably the best Nancy Drew game of the series.  This game finds Nancy in a creepy mansion in England attempting to find out why an old friend appears to be under a curse.  Her adventures take her all over the mansion, which is clearly hiding some secrets.  The mansion is delightfully spooky, and there are plenty of spooky happenings to add to the atmosphere.  This game has some of the most challenging puzzles of all the Nancy Drew games.  It's also quite long.

Seriously, it was so much fun, and I was constantly getting chills from the scary storyline.  I was really needing this game as before this game HERinteractive wasn't really doing too great with their games.\n\nStory-Your neighbor has asked you to go to England to check on her daughter, Linda.  Linda has suddenly started hiding behind a curtain in her bedroom and refused to let anyone see her.  She has also started to have temper tantrums, which according to her mother are totally unlike her.  You soon realize that something supernatural may be behind this sudden change in behavior.\n\nGraphics-Okay, so these didn't get too much better, but they are still good.  All the spooky areas are dark, while the mansion is always lit up, and I did find the artwork rather well done.\n\nSound-The voice acting was very good in my opinion as was the music.  There are lots of songs in this game, I thought, and I liked them all.\n\nGameplay-Everything is the same except you don't leave the manor ever and the puzzles are HARD.  This was the first game where I found there were tons of puzzles and they were challenging without being frustrating.  Whenever you get stuck you can ask a parrot for hints, but you cannot call Bess and George in this game although you can call Ned.\n\nFun-This game is so fun, and it is really scary, too.  I just want to mention that some people will not want to play this game because it does talk of witches, werewolves, alchemy, and rituals.  I didn't find it satanic or anything, but I think some people will want to skip this game if they don't like things like that.\n\nLength-I must have played this 1 or 2 months!  It was so fun!  And, still, when I replay it, it takes me 12-15 hours to finish.  It is really long, and I loved that!\n\nThis is the perfect PC game that I recommend to everyone except those who are concerned about the above mentioned.

The woman has apparently become sick shortly after her new marriage. Rumors abound that the Beast of Blackmoor is creeping around, along with a family witch.\n\nSuspects include Linda's stepdaughter Jane Penvellyn, scholar Nigel Mookerjee, batty old Mrs. Drake, and Jane's tutor Ethel Bosinny.\n\nThe villain and the Penvellyn treasure were both RIDICULOUS. All that threatening atmosphere and chilling spookiness wasted on such silly things.\n\nPuzzles: C\n\nArgh! Just aargh! So many of them! And so tedious they were! The premise is that the Penvellyn family has a long and illustrious history of being geniuses of one kind or another. Each member of the family studied a certain subject, such as computers or astronomy. And they all left clues for future generations to a great hidden treasure (there it is again). The clues are all crazily scattered all over the manor, hidden in Latin crests and books and alchemical symbols.\n\nYou also have to talk to an 80-year-old parrot to solve one puzzle. The family trusted a huge and important secret partly to a parrot that could keel over at any moment. (Yes, they live a long time, but not every parrot lives so long.)\n\nOther silly details include a revolving room and a strange map that somehow tracks your progress through an area, even though GPS wasn't invented way back when.\n\nThey could have left out the anacronistic map, sure, but then we would have been in serious trouble. The gamers needed all the help they could get in this game. The puzles just kept going and going. The game was long and involved.\n\nGameplay: C\n\nNancy is supposedly in England and we aren't allowed to see a single bit of the English countryside. Why? Because Mrs. Drake doesn't want us tracking mud through the house. If I came a thousand miles to another country, nobody would stop me from taking a look outside! This game didn't even have to be set in England. It could have taken place in Salem, Mass. just as easily. (Of course, the Penvellyn family wouldn't have been as old then.)\n\nI couldn't trigger some events in the game no matter how carefully I played or what walkthrough I followed. I ended up downloading saved games from other people to get past these parts of the game. It lessened the quality of the gameplay for me, to say the least.\n\nOne thing I loved were Jane's mini-games. Sometimes I open the game just to play Skull and Bones.\n\nTime Changes: The alarm clock is back. Argh!\n\nVoice Acting: B\n\nJane is a cute, cultured little English girl. Ethel got on my nerves, appearing out of nowhere and looking down her nose at me. Linda irritated me, her voice and character. I mean, I realize you're depressed, but I flew a thousand miles to help you, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just answer my questions instead of clamming up, okay, lady?\n\nThe cockney rhyming slang was extra cool, though.\n\nMusic: A\n\nVery restrained and classical. Chilling and spooky when it needed to be.\n\nIGraphics/Video: A\n\nJane in particular was weirdly animated. All joints and long legs. I think she was too thin.\n\nOther than that, the graphics were the best yet. Bonus points for the smooth animated sequences in between player-controlled action.\n\nTechnical: C\n\nAlong with the problem I had triggering events, I had another glitch in the game. When ordering food from the restaurant, it would appear on a silver platter in my room. But, after that, I could never get other food to be delivered, no matter how long I waited or how many times I asked for it. Every time I lifted the lid, it would always be the first thing I had ordered.\n\nOverall, it was a good game, but it's definitely not my favorite.</td><td>04 2, 2007</td><td>A2PXVOXNYAPPU6</td><td>Bethany L.

The puzzles are hard and you are obliged to play several games with the little girl in the story, Jane, in order to obtain certain tools to proceed. These games within the game did get a bit tedious, but I am was hopelessly slow at \"Petroglyph Punch\" and the like. And it took me five tries to gather up 13 ghosts milling around the manor. When something is timed I panic. I'm like my cats who vanish if I even look at the door where the vacuum cleaner is kept.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, and if the British accents aren't authentic, so what. The images of the characters are very well done, the gestures and mouth synchronization very natural. Mrs. Drake is particularly good, she's rather like a watered down version of Mrs. Danvers.\n\nI could not have finished this game without the help of a walkthrough. The puzzles are hard.

Since the 2003 version I have noticed a significant slowing of my computing but have been unable to identify the source.\n\nI ran four different anti-spyware programs, I \"cleansed\" the system using all of Norton's utilities and still my computer was painfully slow hanging up on startup and shutdown. I even ran Hijack This and scrupulously followed the tutorial on MajorGeeks. My problems grew progressively worse until I read somewhere that Norton might well be causing my problems.\n\nAt first I discounted this possibility out of hand - I mean, after all, this was a premier program that had been around for years! Their new CEO is touted as the second coming by all of the business magazines and newspapers. Surely, IT couldn't be the source of my problems. But out of frustration I took Norton off of my computer and VOIL my problems went away! I couldn't believe it. No more computer crashes, no more slovenly performance, no more hanging up on shutdown and interminable startup times.\n\nI was then confronted with finding another program to supplant Norton. I searched Cnet and came up with PC-Cillin! This program works great. I does not degrade performance one iota! No hanging up on shutdown or interminable startup times. This program works silently in the background and is literally updated daily in 3 - 5 seconds. I couldn't possibly be more pleased.\n\nThe firewall in this program seems to work OK - I am unable to appreciate a significant difference from my free version of Zone Alarm.  Spam control implementation is very clumsy, as are most other programs, and it would seem it will be awhile until we get a seamless elegant spam control solution, at least from Trend Micro.  Spyware is certainly no better than Ad-aware.\n\nFor the life of me I cannot understand how a company as distinguished as Symantec could fritter away all their goodwill and reputation by putting out a program that is quite simply awful.

That's a plus right out of the starting gate.\n\nI originally switched to Trend from Norton after having slowdowns and resource shortages. Norton is very large and very slow, but by and large it worked for me. I was hesitant to make the switch, but I decided to do it anyway and see how Trend's product works. I have not been disappointed. First off, the memory footprint for this package is about half that of Norton when everything is turned on. For me, that's important - Norton takes up huge amounts of memory and slows the system down, where Trend takes up less room and seems to be a lot faster at execution time.\n\nTrend has always had a very fast and very effective antivirus. This latest version is no exception. However, where this package seems to shine most brightly in the antivirus arena is in the timeliness of pattern file updates. Less than a week after the release of a particular email virus, Trend caught it arriving in my inbox and terminated it before it could do anything. To have a pattern for a brand new virus and already be able to handle it is a very, very good thing.\n\nThe firewall itself is quite effective and it seems to do its job very efficiently. Where it tends to bother people is in the fact that it is a very quiet firewall and it does not notify for every little thing like Norton or ZoneLabs do. This may or may not agree with you, but for me I'm content that it's working in the background and isn't bothering me with every little thing that happens.\n\nThe spyware detection feature seems to have come of age, and even after running SpyBot S&D and Ad-Aware, it still found spyware on my system. It did a good job cleaning up and it did everything very fast and efficiently.\n\nThere are a couple of things I cannot test, as I am on dialup. There are new network protection features that allow remote security administration for systems on the network running Trend's suite, and there is also a neat feature that loooks for intruders on wireless networks. Considering that cybersquatting on wireless networks is very common, this is an important feature that should be in all security suites. If you are running a wireless network, this feature will be invaluable.\n\nTrend includes a parental control feature in its suite, and it works in a fashion similar to Norton's and ZoneLab's equivalents. You pick your categories to block, and you're done. However, there is a flaw in their implementation - the blocking only seems to work with MS Internet Explorer. So, if you use Mozilla/FireFox or Opera, you're out of luck if you want to use the URL blocking.\n\nThere is also an antispam feature, but it is not going to prevent spam from arriving in your inbox. Rather, it simply flags questionable messages as spam in the subject at delivery. This can help with sorting and disposal, but it will not keep it from being delivered. In my opinion, spam should never reach the email client if you have an antispam solution in place, so I regard this particular feature as ineffective. I suppose it is better than nothing, though, and many users will find it helpful - I don't. I didn't like Norton's, either, which works the same way.\n\nOne interesting feature that Trend sports is \"Outbreak Notification\" which is used to alert users when a new, high-risk threat is circulating. Users will get a notification when a new high-profile virus is spreading, and that can be helpful if you're relying on manual updates.\n\nTrend Micro has put together a winner in their 2005 edition of their PC-Cillin Internet Security suite. It does not lack any major features, and the majority of the things they have included are very good and very effective. There are a few soft spots, but these are not critical to system security, and overall Trend is quickly catching up to the \"big boys.\" If you want a fast, small-footprint security solution that competes very competently with the likes of Norton, ZoneLabs and McAfee, Trend is an excellent contender.</td><td>11 18, 2004</td><td>A34VRVI4CSI5RQ</td><td>Matt Morgan</td><td>null</td><td>Excellent Security Suite, But Not Perfect</td><td>1100736000</td><td>false</td><td>420</td></tr><tr><td>B00068IBZW</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>***\nI don't mind the negative feedback.

Plenty of space, definitely enough RAM and a fast enough Pentium 4 CPU.

At this point, however, I cannot recommend the product to anyone who needs a 100% reliable installation the first time.  For that, I would recommend McAfee 9.0.

For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.\n\nIt's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)\n\nAs I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.</td><td>10 20, 2010</td><td>A38NELQT98S4H8</td><td>WB Halper</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5</td><td>1287532800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed.

Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on \"the best way to lay out a site using CSS\" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.\n\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.\n\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\n\nUI - at the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.</td><td>10 18, 2010</td><td>A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</td><td>Grimmy</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A good value</td><td>1287360000</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.

Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\n\nWith this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from \"Adobe Certified Instructors\", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.\n\nFor the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a \"test\" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\n\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I've simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you'll be learning on the videos.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n1) HTML Refresher - This is an excellent section for someone who already knows HTML, but could use a refresher in the form of a \"crash course.\"  You'll find a URL overview, an HTML intro (tags, how some browsers read tags differently, and what Dreamweaver \"does behind the scenes).\n\n2) Dreamweaver Introduction - You'll finally be able to learn what WYSIWYG is, you'll be introduced to Dreamweaver Design, Code, and split screens, and the welcome screen.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.\n\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\n\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\n\n  What this is\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\n  - A great overview of using DW\n\nWhat it isn't\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.</td><td>10 12, 2010</td><td>AYUF7YETYOLNX</td><td>Bryan Newman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>A Fantastic Overview of Dream Weaver and Web Design in General</td><td>1286841600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I decided (after trying a number of other products) to switch to the gold standard of web site management, Dreamweaver.

Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.\n\nThe opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\n\nI'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.\nAt some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version.

Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.\n\nThere are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.\n\nAll in all, this is a great product for the price.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A2WCFDOCS73PNB</td><td>Gadgetman</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Excellent value for the price</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>0321719816</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Even though I use Dreamweaver a great deal and own several books on the subject, I found this set very helpful. Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.\n\nThe videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (\"Fireworks\" for \"Firefox,\" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.\n\nSince each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the \"Watch and work\" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.\n\nNew features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.\n\nIf you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.</td><td>10 28, 2010</td><td>A14638TGYH7GD9</td><td>Rebecca Haden</td><td>List(null,  DVD-ROM, null, null, null, null, null)</td><td>Buy this with your copy of Dreamweaver</td><td>1288224000</td><td>false</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Task2  Show the schema of of the dataset."],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = sqlContext.sql(\"SELECT * FROM df_table\")\ndf.printSchema()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">root\n-- asin: string (nullable = true)\n-- image: array (nullable = true)\n    |-- element: string (containsNull = true)\n-- overall: double (nullable = true)\n-- reviewText: string (nullable = true)\n-- reviewTime: string (nullable = true)\n-- reviewerID: string (nullable = true)\n-- reviewerName: string (nullable = true)\n-- style: struct (nullable = true)\n    |-- Color:: string (nullable = true)\n    |-- Format:: string (nullable = true)\n    |-- Package Type:: string (nullable = true)\n    |-- Platform:: string (nullable = true)\n    |-- Size:: string (nullable = true)\n    |-- Style Name:: string (nullable = true)\n    |-- Style:: string (nullable = true)\n-- summary: string (nullable = true)\n-- unixReviewTime: long (nullable = true)\n-- verified: boolean (nullable = true)\n-- vote: string (nullable = true)\n\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7}],"metadata":{"name":"task 1","notebookId":1013683007266543},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
